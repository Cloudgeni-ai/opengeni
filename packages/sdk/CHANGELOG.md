# @opengeni/sdk

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- f42cd4a: Replace the old queue and interruption surface with one revisioned prompt queue, durable composer drafts, atomic Steer, recursive Pause/Resume, workspace control invalidation, stale-client contract fencing, and a shared accessible queue UI for first- and third-party consumers. Remove the obsolete passive child-notification setting so every child terminal result follows the one bounded, coalescible internal-update contract.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 0805620: Make active-sandbox pointer swaps establishment-safe. A swap or create-time seed to a target no turn can establish (a non-group Modal sibling, or an unknown backend kind) is now rejected before the epoch-fenced pointer commit with a typed rejection `code`, leaving the pointer and epoch untouched. At turn start a persisted pointer whose target is structurally unestablishable (a deleted sandbox row, a Modal sibling, or an enrollment-less selfhosted row) is reset to the session home under the epoch fence and announced with a new `session.route.reconciled` event, honoring a concurrent higher-epoch swap rather than clobbering it. A null pointer resolves to the session home backend, and the routing proxy's per-op cache is keyed on the full `(activeEpoch, activeSandboxId)` tuple so a clear-to-null re-lands the next op on home rather than a stale swapped-to session. Adds the optional `SwapActiveSandboxResponse.code` discriminant and the `session.route.reconciled` session event type to the public contracts and SDK wire types.
- b804fd4: Add provider-neutral git credential contracts and runtime sandbox token-file seeding for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. Sandboxes now provision `gh`, `glab`, and `az` wrappers that read current token files at invocation time without storing token values in manifests.
- e4d3569: Add per-member workspace session pins with stable pinned-first listing, subject-scoped FORCE-RLS persistence, snapshot-backed activity pagination, optimistic OCC-safe pin/unpin updates, and accessible responsive web controls.

### Patch Changes

- ad4502a: Make the workbench and console dependency-safe, keep list identities stable, preserve caught error causes, isolate desktop consent tests from real transports, and enforce warning-free repository lint plus aggregate React tests in CI.
- 04d7595: Discover repositories at any workspace nesting depth, including linked worktrees whose `.git` marker is a file, while pruning dependency/build residue and enforcing timeout and repository-count bounds. An incomplete discovery now persists an epoch-fenced degraded capture revision, announces its typed reason, and makes clients prefer live workspace data instead of presenting a misleading empty capture.
- faf1487: Add workspace-local, holder-fenced Codex subscription leases with deterministic
  fairness across worker replicas, explicit allocator eligibility, and
  failure-classified same-turn failover. All-exhausted active goals now persist one
  generation- and policy-fenced capacity waiter, wake from authoritative reset
  timers or revisioned capacity mutations, survive Temporal restart and
  continue-as-new, and enqueue at most one normal continuation without synthetic
  user messages, full-turn replay, provider/model rewriting, or automatic
  entitlement redemption.

  Expose a generic accepted-turn policy-scope and per-scope unavailable-diagnostic
  seam for future named pools while resolving exact live/frozen same-turn reuse
  before membership filtering. Preserve manual versus policy pin semantics and
  session-sharded cache affinity without moving an in-flight lease or the legacy
  workspace pointer for policy homes.

- 4a25bfc: Add the `machine.link.lost`, `machine.link.restored`, and `machine.runner.restarted` session-event types for Connected Machine control-link observability (the failure-visibility doctrine's link plane). These are session-scoped, announce-only diagnostics fanned out only to the sessions that had an active op running on the machine when its control link changed — never to idle or historical sessions. A clean going-offline emits `machine.link.lost` (plus `machine.runner.restarted` when the reason is a self-update restart), and a reconnect Hello that actually cleared a going-offline marker emits `machine.link.restored`. All three project to the timeline's quiet tier (no rendered item) and are mirrored in the SDK event-type list. Adds the `sessionsWithActiveOpOnEnrollment` DB helper (one indexed lookup, no per-op tracking table) that resolves the fan-out target set.
- 3148404: Add the `machine.op.failed` and `machine.op.recovered` session-event types for Connected Machine op-outcome observability (the failure-visibility doctrine's out-of-band plane). These are session-scoped, announce-only diagnostics: `machine.op.failed` fires for infrastructure fault classes only (offline, draining-exhausted, payload-too-large, reconnecting-timeout, OS/stream/protocol) — never for a semantic miss the model asked about (a missing path, a consent gate, a nonzero exit); `machine.op.recovered` is the quiet healed-fault leading indicator. Both project to the timeline's quiet tier (no rendered item), mirrored in the SDK event-type list.
- a5f58f9: Make "stop" mean stop, and stop the child-completion flood from outrunning it.

  - **Stop drains the queue.** A non-steer interrupt now cancels the active turn AND all queued turns, emitting one `turn.queue_drained` summary event. Steer still promotes exactly one steered message.
  - **A user-paused goal is sacred.** A machine child-completion turn can no longer re-activate a goal the user paused (`goal_set` is refused for such callers), and the wake text drops the "resume it now" nudge when the manager's own goal is user-paused. The caller is classified by its own signed turn identity (a new `turnId` claim on the first-party MCP token), not the session's live active pointer — so the guard cannot be raced into refusing a legitimate human `goal_set`.
  - **Child-completion notifications coalesce.** N spawned workers reaching terminal states now fold into ONE queued digest turn (one model run) instead of N turns, so the flood can no longer outrun a human's stop button. Each worker still gets its own result card.
  - **Human messages preempt machine notifications.** A person's message jumps ahead of any queued child-completion notification turns (behind the running turn and earlier human turns) — it never waits behind a flood of "worker FAILED" notices.
  - **Child-completion suppression opt-in.** A new first-party `set_child_notifications_mode` tool lets a manager switch spawned-worker completions to `passive`: they appear as timeline cards only and never queue a turn or a model run. `digest` remains the default.
  - **Honest steering copy.** The composer no longer claims steer "injects this message now"; it cancels the current step and runs the message next while the goal continues, and the stop button says it clears queued messages and pauses the goal.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 602db89: Add Toolspace programmatic tool access for sandboxes.

  The new `toolspace:call` permission is an explicit, session-bound delegated grant for sandbox code. When `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_ENABLED=true`, worker turns mint a narrow `ogd_` token to a sandbox token file and expose `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL`; the first-party MCP route uses that token to compose the session's safe first-party, capability-backed, and per-session MCP tools, with approval-required tools denied as MCP `isError` results.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 7bfe593: Surface the desktop-capture-blocked reason as server-visible enrollment state.

  A machine can have a display it cannot CAPTURE (macOS Screen Recording / TCC not granted). The agent's connect Hello already withholds the desktop cell in that case; this persists a human, actionable reason alongside it so the Machines dashboard / VM picker can render "display: capture not granted" instead of a bare `display_unavailable`.

  - **Contracts / SDK**: `MachineView` (and `EnrollmentSummary`) gain an additive, nullable `desktopUnavailableReason`. Non-null only when a display exists but capture is blocked; `null` == capture permitted OR genuinely headless. Absent/`null` ⇒ byte-identical to today's shape for existing consumers.
  - **DB**: new nullable `enrollments.desktop_unavailable_reason` column (no backfill — `NULL` preserves the existing "capture-permitted or headless" semantics). The display-cursor writer now persists `has_display` AND the reason together, change-guarded on either field, and self-heals to `null` on the next Hello once the grant is restored.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- e513236: Add an optional per-session `instructions` field to `CreateSessionRequest`: a first-class, system-level agent persona lever composed AFTER the per-workspace `agentInstructions` (session-specific last, non-bypassable CORE preserved). It is org-visible session metadata (returned on the session record) but is never emitted as a timeline event, so hosts can deliver per-agent-type prompts without leaking prompt content into the user-visible timeline or weakening instruction authority. Absent ⇒ byte-identical to today's composition.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 3d708b5: Add compact event replay support for history windows and switch React session-event loading to capped compact pages with coalesced-delta resume cursors.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 15deca0: Add per-session third-party MCP servers with write-only encrypted headers, metadata-only responses/events, `mcp_servers:attach` permission gating, and per-message credential rotation.
- 5e56bcd: Add tail-first session event loading with reverse durable pagination, older-history loading controls, and timeline props for smooth prepend pagination.

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 5962dd0: Republish the closure so published manifests reference `@opengeni/contracts@^0.4.0`. The previous `^0.3.0` ranges exclude 0.4.0 under 0.x caret semantics, causing consumers to nest a stale contracts copy that lacks the current export surface.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a4f370f: Carve the connected-machine UI into a dedicated `@opengeni/react/machines` subpath, and add `workingDir` to the SDK create-session request.

  - **`@opengeni/react`**: the bring-your-own-compute surface (`useMachines`, `MachinesDashboard`, `MachineCard`, `MachineDockBar`, `SharedMachineDisclosure`, `MachineStatusPill`, `ConnectionStatusPill`, `ConnectionDot`, `MachineMetrics`, `EnrollmentDeviceFlow`, `EnrollmentConsent`, `connectionStatusForState`, and the `MachineView` / `MachineState` / `MachineKind` / `MachinesResponse` / `MetricSample` view-model types) now lives at `@opengeni/react/machines`. The root keeps re-exporting it for backwards compatibility — **non-breaking** — but the root re-export is **deprecated** and will move in a future major. Import from `@opengeni/react/machines` going forward.
  - **`@opengeni/sdk`**: `CreateSessionRequest` gains an optional `workingDir?: string` field — the host working directory for a connected-machine target (the agent runs there; defaults to the machine's launch dir). Ignored for managed sandboxes.

- d9d7743: Render the self-hosted desktop stream: a PNG-frame canvas client for `transport: "relay-frames"`.

  Self-hosted machines stream their desktop as PNG-per-frame protobuf datagrams over the relay (not RFB), so the noVNC/RFB viewer could never render them — the desktop went "warm" but the live stream never came up. This adds `useRelayFrameStream`, a view-only canvas renderer that opens the relay channel, decodes each PNG frame, and paints it (latest-wins backpressure so a slow decode never queues). `useDesktopStream` now dispatches on `DesktopStream.transport`: `"vnc-ws"` → noVNC (Modal boxes), `"relay-frames"` → the frame renderer (self-hosted machines). The `DesktopStream.transport` / `client` unions gain `"relay-frames"` / `"frames"`. View-only in v1 (matches the machine's read-only mode); interactive input is a follow-up.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 48c0d2e: Add session titles. A session now has a short display title that the agent generates itself: on the genesis turn a hidden, non-persisted directive asks the agent to call the new `set_session_title` tool, so the session is named on its own model with no extra LLM call. Users (and agents with `sessions:control`, via `set_other_session_title`) can rename; a user-set title is permanent and is never clobbered by agent writes.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: `Session.title` / `Session.titleSource`, `UpdateSessionRequest`, and the `session.title_set` event.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: `client.updateSession(workspaceId, sessionId, { title })`.
  - `@opengeni/react`: `useSession().updateTitle(...)`, live `session.title_set` handling, and `sessionDisplayTitle` now prefers `session.title`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a1c82c5: Add the world-class timeline tool-call renderer module and the sandbox-surfacing client surface to `@opengeni/react`.

  - **Timeline renderers**: per-tool disclosure cards (full-row toggle, keyboard-accessible), screenshots → lightbox, theme-aware Pierre diffs, turn-collapse summary chips, sub-agent worker/goal landmarks, a consumer-extensible tool registry, and complete state handling (running / complete / failed / cancelled), each with its own affordance.
  - **Sandbox surfacing**: file/terminal/git/desktop hooks and components (`useSandboxFiles`, `useSandboxTerminal`, `useSandboxGit`, `useDesktopStream`, `useTerminalStream`, `useSessionCapabilities`, `SandboxFiles`, `SandboxTerminal`, `DesktopViewer`, `WorkspaceDock`, Pierre diff/file views, `CodeEditor`).

  All additive; `MessageTimeline`'s `items` contract is unchanged. The internal `compactPayloadPreview` helper was removed from the public surface.

### Patch Changes

- 2989163: Add a `deleteDocument` client helper for removing documents from document bases.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- a78a09b: Publish the SDK source that adds `OpenGeniClient.getClientConfig()` (returns `ClientConfig`). The method was added to the source but never republished, while `@opengeni/react@0.3.0` already depends on it — so react@0.3.0 consumers could not typecheck against the published sdk@0.2.0. Released as a patch so it stays within react@0.3.0's `^0.2.0` range.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 21c1535: Initial public release of the OpenGeni client packages.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: shared zod wire-contract schemas and types.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: zero-dependency, framework-agnostic TypeScript client with typed API, session lifecycle, and SSE streaming (reconnect + replay-by-sequence).
  - `@opengeni/react`: React hooks and styled components built on `@opengeni/sdk`.

  All three now ship ESM + `.d.ts` builds via tsup and are published to npm with provenance.
