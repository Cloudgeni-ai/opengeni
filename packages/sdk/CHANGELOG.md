# @opengeni/sdk

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- d1dee7a: Let embedding hosts read and update an existing session MCP server's approval
  policy through the public API, SDK, and React session hook. Each claimed
  attempt freezes its policy under the session lock, so updates affect the next
  attempt without reinterpreting work already running; model MCP and
  Toolspace/Code Mode consume the same exact snapshot. Toolspace tokens and
  side-effect receipts bind every proxied call to the exact active attempt, so
  Pause, Steer, recovery, and late outputs preserve one authoritative owner.

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 9f84cc9: Add durable host-provided per-turn instructions, headless structured-input hooks, host-local queue
  focus, and reusable approval and human-input surfaces for embedded session consumers.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 136227e: Add an immutable, versioned curated skill library with explicit workspace selection and inspectable provenance, and preserve WCAG AA contrast for dark-theme primary actions.
- 3aee519: Add a workspace-accepted, provider-agnostic transcription policy and host-adapter contract, plus an accessible composer microphone that keeps partials ephemeral and appends non-empty accepted finals to the editable draft exactly once. Policies explicitly accept automatic language detection and speaker diarization, events can carry strict neutral result metadata, pending starts and cleanup are abortable/bounded, and adapter failures stay behind controlled UI copy with redacted non-UI diagnostics.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 4401ce7: Add a scope-checked host MCP credential resolver to the public embedding port and use it consistently for model-visible MCP tools and Toolspace/Code Mode while preserving the standalone connection broker as the default. Requests carry both the immediate session and its workspace-scoped lineage root so embedded hosts can authorize child sessions through one durable root binding. Provider-neutral bindings now carry a provider family, provider host, opaque host binding id, and exact selected-repository set; successful credentials must echo the complete binding before headers are accepted. Incompatible endpoint authentication and unenforceable resource containment surface as explicit unavailable states instead of starting a duplicate OpenGeni provider connection.
- c389adc: Add a provider-neutral host run-credential port with frozen turn/session lineage,
  off-manifest environment and file generations, proactive renewal, attempt-safe
  cleanup with bounded generation retention, output redaction hints, and structured
  reconnect UI support. Hosts can explicitly opt a frozen target out, and the
  POSIX materializer supports both Linux `flock` and a portable directory-lock
  fallback with cross-platform base64 decoding.
- d249403: Allow embedding hosts to preallocate a session UUID before OpenGeni admits the
  initial turn. Session creation preserves idempotent replays of the same UUID and
  returns a conflict for UUID reuse or an idempotency replay that changes identity.
  The additive create response also returns `initialTurnId`, so an embedding host
  can correlate a preallocated host run without misusing the nullable
  `activeTurnId` execution pointer.
- a11a7fc: Support mixed GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps repositories—including multiple
  accounts or installations for one provider—in a single session through bounded,
  host-opaque credential bindings and optional read/write access intent.

  Validate binding/provider/host echoes before token injection, isolate tokens in
  hashed binding files, select Git credentials by remote path, fail provider CLIs
  closed on ambiguous bindings, and renew each binding independently while keeping
  legacy one-binding-per-provider request and file aliases compatible.

- dda6398: Add durable structured human-input tool calls with exact-turn ownership,
  answer/skip/expiry/cancellation outcomes, restart-safe Temporal resumption,
  authorized API and SDK methods, and headless plus styled React embed surfaces.
- e8ca4f6: Let trusted embedding hosts sign a service-only causal initiator separately
  from the delegated subject that authorizes a create, Send, or Steer command.
  Freeze that service and its non-secret provenance onto the new session/turn,
  while rejecting human impersonation, exact agent-attempt replacement, reserved
  lineage fields, the legacy migration sentinel, and oversized provenance.
  Service-provenance HTTP tokens use a prefix-bound `ogd2_` envelope so older
  rolling-deploy verifiers fail closed instead of silently stripping attribution.
- 736f4fe: Persist and expose one immutable subject-or-service initiator for every accepted turn, including creator-safe idempotent repair, queue-edit preservation, exact live-attempt fencing for agent-created sessions, signed agent inheritance, causally dominant Agent Steer attribution, explicit service producers, rolling legacy backfill, and database-enforced immutability.
  Bounded agent provenance now retains its first causal hop together with the
  newest hops, so deep child chains do not discard their root authority when the
  middle of the audit path is truncated.

### Patch Changes

- 1fcd83d: Make repository mount paths provider-neutral and collision-free. Omitted paths
  now resolve to a canonical host-aware default that distinguishes GitHub,
  GitLab, Azure DevOps, and custom hosts, while one shared portable-path validator
  rejects traversal and case-folded collisions before sandbox execution.

  Hosts upgrading sessions persisted without `mountPath` should expect those
  repositories to materialize at the new host-aware location. To preserve an
  existing warm workspace location, stamp the session's former effective
  `repos/<owner>/<repo>` path explicitly before upgrading. Previously accepted
  explicit paths that are non-portable or collide after Unicode normalization and
  case folding now fail validation and must be renamed.

- 51f45a3: Publish the session-only React entry point and typed session control surface in a stable registry release.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- dbb6232: Support linking an existing GitHub App installation to multiple OpenGeni workspaces with independent repository allowlists.

  - Discover installations through GitHub App user OAuth, require repository-level administrator permission, and configure the OAuth callback in generated App manifests.
  - Persist workspace-scoped installation bindings and repository selections while retaining legacy `all` bindings for compatibility.
  - Enforce the current binding during repository listing, session admission, MCP token minting, and GitHub-authenticated worker turn startup.
  - Add SDK and web controls to link, rescope, and unlink a workspace without uninstalling the GitHub App or affecting another workspace.

### Patch Changes

- bb09be8: Add a session-only React entrypoint and mirror MCP approval policy in
  the public SDK type.
- Bound model-facing tool output, complete input accounting, compact session discovery,
  event and realtime projections, authorized evidence retrieval, and compaction failure
  convergence with explicit truncation and loss metadata throughout the output lifecycle.
  Session event `latest` lookups are now class-exclusive across REST, MCP, and SDK clients.
  Updated-order session discovery now uses a transactional workspace activity-revision fence,
  and the workspace-control bounds migration rewrites only historical cap violations.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- ec0697a: Ship the production-hardened captured workspace workbench, physically verified Steer/Pause cancellation across cloud, local, and self-hosted model tools, pre-model preparation, sandbox provisioning, and lifecycle/setup commands, durable quiescence admission fencing, cancellation-aware SDK reads and turn cleanup, single-round-trip pruned workspace indexing, truthful shutdown states, a responsive and accessible review dock, Unicode coverage, and package-safe CSS/SSR integration.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- f42cd4a: Replace the old queue and interruption surface with one revisioned prompt queue, durable composer drafts, atomic Steer, recursive Pause/Resume, workspace control invalidation, stale-client contract fencing, and a shared accessible queue UI for first- and third-party consumers. Remove the obsolete passive child-notification setting so every child terminal result follows the one bounded, coalescible internal-update contract.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 0805620: Make active-sandbox pointer swaps establishment-safe. A swap or create-time seed to a target no turn can establish (a non-group Modal sibling, or an unknown backend kind) is now rejected before the epoch-fenced pointer commit with a typed rejection `code`, leaving the pointer and epoch untouched. At turn start a persisted pointer whose target is structurally unestablishable (a deleted sandbox row, a Modal sibling, or an enrollment-less selfhosted row) is reset to the session home under the epoch fence and announced with a new `session.route.reconciled` event, honoring a concurrent higher-epoch swap rather than clobbering it. A null pointer resolves to the session home backend, and the routing proxy's per-op cache is keyed on the full `(activeEpoch, activeSandboxId)` tuple so a clear-to-null re-lands the next op on home rather than a stale swapped-to session. Adds the optional `SwapActiveSandboxResponse.code` discriminant and the `session.route.reconciled` session event type to the public contracts and SDK wire types.
- b804fd4: Add provider-neutral git credential contracts and runtime sandbox token-file seeding for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. Sandboxes now provision `gh`, `glab`, and `az` wrappers that read current token files at invocation time without storing token values in manifests.
- e4d3569: Add per-member workspace session pins with stable pinned-first listing, subject-scoped FORCE-RLS persistence, snapshot-backed activity pagination, optimistic OCC-safe pin/unpin updates, and accessible responsive web controls.

### Patch Changes

- ad4502a: Make the workbench and console dependency-safe, keep list identities stable, preserve caught error causes, isolate desktop consent tests from real transports, and enforce warning-free repository lint plus aggregate React tests in CI.
- 04d7595: Discover repositories at any workspace nesting depth, including linked worktrees whose `.git` marker is a file, while pruning dependency/build residue and enforcing timeout and repository-count bounds. An incomplete discovery now persists an epoch-fenced degraded capture revision, announces its typed reason, and makes clients prefer live workspace data instead of presenting a misleading empty capture.
- faf1487: Add workspace-local, holder-fenced Codex subscription leases with deterministic
  fairness across worker replicas, explicit allocator eligibility, and
  failure-classified same-turn failover. All-exhausted active goals now persist one
  generation- and policy-fenced capacity waiter, wake from authoritative reset
  timers or revisioned capacity mutations, survive Temporal restart and
  continue-as-new, and enqueue at most one normal continuation without synthetic
  user messages, full-turn replay, provider/model rewriting, or automatic
  entitlement redemption.

  Expose a generic accepted-turn policy-scope and per-scope unavailable-diagnostic
  seam for future named pools while resolving exact live/frozen same-turn reuse
  before membership filtering. Preserve manual versus policy pin semantics and
  session-sharded cache affinity without moving an in-flight lease or the legacy
  workspace pointer for policy homes.

- 4a25bfc: Add the `machine.link.lost`, `machine.link.restored`, and `machine.runner.restarted` session-event types for Connected Machine control-link observability (the failure-visibility doctrine's link plane). These are session-scoped, announce-only diagnostics fanned out only to the sessions that had an active op running on the machine when its control link changed — never to idle or historical sessions. A clean going-offline emits `machine.link.lost` (plus `machine.runner.restarted` when the reason is a self-update restart), and a reconnect Hello that actually cleared a going-offline marker emits `machine.link.restored`. All three project to the timeline's quiet tier (no rendered item) and are mirrored in the SDK event-type list. Adds the `sessionsWithActiveOpOnEnrollment` DB helper (one indexed lookup, no per-op tracking table) that resolves the fan-out target set.
- 3148404: Add the `machine.op.failed` and `machine.op.recovered` session-event types for Connected Machine op-outcome observability (the failure-visibility doctrine's out-of-band plane). These are session-scoped, announce-only diagnostics: `machine.op.failed` fires for infrastructure fault classes only (offline, draining-exhausted, payload-too-large, reconnecting-timeout, OS/stream/protocol) — never for a semantic miss the model asked about (a missing path, a consent gate, a nonzero exit); `machine.op.recovered` is the quiet healed-fault leading indicator. Both project to the timeline's quiet tier (no rendered item), mirrored in the SDK event-type list.
- a5f58f9: Make "stop" mean stop, and stop the child-completion flood from outrunning it.

  - **Stop drains the queue.** A non-steer interrupt now cancels the active turn AND all queued turns, emitting one `turn.queue_drained` summary event. Steer still promotes exactly one steered message.
  - **A user-paused goal is sacred.** A machine child-completion turn can no longer re-activate a goal the user paused (`goal_set` is refused for such callers), and the wake text drops the "resume it now" nudge when the manager's own goal is user-paused. The caller is classified by its own signed turn identity (a new `turnId` claim on the first-party MCP token), not the session's live active pointer — so the guard cannot be raced into refusing a legitimate human `goal_set`.
  - **Child-completion notifications coalesce.** N spawned workers reaching terminal states now fold into ONE queued digest turn (one model run) instead of N turns, so the flood can no longer outrun a human's stop button. Each worker still gets its own result card.
  - **Human messages preempt machine notifications.** A person's message jumps ahead of any queued child-completion notification turns (behind the running turn and earlier human turns) — it never waits behind a flood of "worker FAILED" notices.
  - **Child-completion suppression opt-in.** A new first-party `set_child_notifications_mode` tool lets a manager switch spawned-worker completions to `passive`: they appear as timeline cards only and never queue a turn or a model run. `digest` remains the default.
  - **Honest steering copy.** The composer no longer claims steer "injects this message now"; it cancels the current step and runs the message next while the goal continues, and the stop button says it clears queued messages and pauses the goal.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 602db89: Add Toolspace programmatic tool access for sandboxes.

  The new `toolspace:call` permission is an explicit, session-bound delegated grant for sandbox code. When `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_ENABLED=true`, worker turns mint a narrow `ogd_` token to a sandbox token file and expose `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL`; the first-party MCP route uses that token to compose the session's safe first-party, capability-backed, and per-session MCP tools, with approval-required tools denied as MCP `isError` results.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 7bfe593: Surface the desktop-capture-blocked reason as server-visible enrollment state.

  A machine can have a display it cannot CAPTURE (macOS Screen Recording / TCC not granted). The agent's connect Hello already withholds the desktop cell in that case; this persists a human, actionable reason alongside it so the Machines dashboard / VM picker can render "display: capture not granted" instead of a bare `display_unavailable`.

  - **Contracts / SDK**: `MachineView` (and `EnrollmentSummary`) gain an additive, nullable `desktopUnavailableReason`. Non-null only when a display exists but capture is blocked; `null` == capture permitted OR genuinely headless. Absent/`null` ⇒ byte-identical to today's shape for existing consumers.
  - **DB**: new nullable `enrollments.desktop_unavailable_reason` column (no backfill — `NULL` preserves the existing "capture-permitted or headless" semantics). The display-cursor writer now persists `has_display` AND the reason together, change-guarded on either field, and self-heals to `null` on the next Hello once the grant is restored.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- e513236: Add an optional per-session `instructions` field to `CreateSessionRequest`: a first-class, system-level agent persona lever composed AFTER the per-workspace `agentInstructions` (session-specific last, non-bypassable CORE preserved). It is org-visible session metadata (returned on the session record) but is never emitted as a timeline event, so hosts can deliver per-agent-type prompts without leaking prompt content into the user-visible timeline or weakening instruction authority. Absent ⇒ byte-identical to today's composition.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 3d708b5: Add compact event replay support for history windows and switch React session-event loading to capped compact pages with coalesced-delta resume cursors.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 15deca0: Add per-session third-party MCP servers with write-only encrypted headers, metadata-only responses/events, `mcp_servers:attach` permission gating, and per-message credential rotation.
- 5e56bcd: Add tail-first session event loading with reverse durable pagination, older-history loading controls, and timeline props for smooth prepend pagination.

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 5962dd0: Republish the closure so published manifests reference `@opengeni/contracts@^0.4.0`. The previous `^0.3.0` ranges exclude 0.4.0 under 0.x caret semantics, causing consumers to nest a stale contracts copy that lacks the current export surface.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a4f370f: Carve the connected-machine UI into a dedicated `@opengeni/react/machines` subpath, and add `workingDir` to the SDK create-session request.

  - **`@opengeni/react`**: the bring-your-own-compute surface (`useMachines`, `MachinesDashboard`, `MachineCard`, `MachineDockBar`, `SharedMachineDisclosure`, `MachineStatusPill`, `ConnectionStatusPill`, `ConnectionDot`, `MachineMetrics`, `EnrollmentDeviceFlow`, `EnrollmentConsent`, `connectionStatusForState`, and the `MachineView` / `MachineState` / `MachineKind` / `MachinesResponse` / `MetricSample` view-model types) now lives at `@opengeni/react/machines`. The root keeps re-exporting it for backwards compatibility — **non-breaking** — but the root re-export is **deprecated** and will move in a future major. Import from `@opengeni/react/machines` going forward.
  - **`@opengeni/sdk`**: `CreateSessionRequest` gains an optional `workingDir?: string` field — the host working directory for a connected-machine target (the agent runs there; defaults to the machine's launch dir). Ignored for managed sandboxes.

- d9d7743: Render the self-hosted desktop stream: a PNG-frame canvas client for `transport: "relay-frames"`.

  Self-hosted machines stream their desktop as PNG-per-frame protobuf datagrams over the relay (not RFB), so the noVNC/RFB viewer could never render them — the desktop went "warm" but the live stream never came up. This adds `useRelayFrameStream`, a view-only canvas renderer that opens the relay channel, decodes each PNG frame, and paints it (latest-wins backpressure so a slow decode never queues). `useDesktopStream` now dispatches on `DesktopStream.transport`: `"vnc-ws"` → noVNC (Modal boxes), `"relay-frames"` → the frame renderer (self-hosted machines). The `DesktopStream.transport` / `client` unions gain `"relay-frames"` / `"frames"`. View-only in v1 (matches the machine's read-only mode); interactive input is a follow-up.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 48c0d2e: Add session titles. A session now has a short display title that the agent generates itself: on the genesis turn a hidden, non-persisted directive asks the agent to call the new `set_session_title` tool, so the session is named on its own model with no extra LLM call. Users (and agents with `sessions:control`, via `set_other_session_title`) can rename; a user-set title is permanent and is never clobbered by agent writes.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: `Session.title` / `Session.titleSource`, `UpdateSessionRequest`, and the `session.title_set` event.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: `client.updateSession(workspaceId, sessionId, { title })`.
  - `@opengeni/react`: `useSession().updateTitle(...)`, live `session.title_set` handling, and `sessionDisplayTitle` now prefers `session.title`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a1c82c5: Add the world-class timeline tool-call renderer module and the sandbox workspace client surface to `@opengeni/react`.

  - **Timeline renderers**: per-tool disclosure cards (full-row toggle, keyboard-accessible), screenshots → lightbox, theme-aware Pierre diffs, turn-collapse summary chips, sub-agent worker/goal landmarks, a consumer-extensible tool registry, and complete state handling (running / complete / failed / cancelled), each with its own affordance.
  - **Sandbox surfacing**: file/terminal/git/desktop hooks and components (`useSandboxFiles`, `useSandboxTerminal`, `useSandboxGit`, `useDesktopStream`, `useTerminalStream`, `useSessionCapabilities`, `SandboxFiles`, `SandboxTerminal`, `DesktopViewer`, `WorkspaceDock`, Pierre diff/file views, `CodeEditor`).

  All additive; `MessageTimeline`'s `items` contract is unchanged. The internal `compactPayloadPreview` helper was removed from the public surface.

### Patch Changes

- 2989163: Add a `deleteDocument` client helper for removing documents from document bases.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- a78a09b: Publish the SDK source that adds `OpenGeniClient.getClientConfig()` (returns `ClientConfig`). The method was added to the source but never republished, while `@opengeni/react@0.3.0` already depends on it — so react@0.3.0 consumers could not typecheck against the published sdk@0.2.0. Released as a patch so it stays within react@0.3.0's `^0.2.0` range.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 21c1535: Initial public release of the OpenGeni client packages.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: shared zod wire-contract schemas and types.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: zero-dependency, framework-agnostic TypeScript client with typed API, session lifecycle, and SSE streaming (reconnect + replay-by-sequence).
  - `@opengeni/react`: React hooks and styled components built on `@opengeni/sdk`.

  All three now ship ESM + `.d.ts` builds via tsup and are published to npm with provenance.
