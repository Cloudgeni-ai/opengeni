# @opengeni/sdk

## 0.46.2

### Patch Changes

- 5d1d0c2: Make browser live streams visibility-aware, share one routed session feed,
  bound reconciliation and heartbeat recovery, coalesce overlapping reads, and
  expose the append, publish, and SSE connection lifecycle in metrics.

## 0.46.0

### Minor Changes

- 6eb0b23: Add production resumable composer transcription with exact-subject durable
  manifests, idempotent SHA-256 chunk uploads, bounded ffmpeg segmentation, one
  recording-wide provider pin, persisted retryable segment results, deterministic
  assembly, cross-browser SDK recovery, object-ledger cleanup, and expiry purging
  of transcript metadata after every provider object is confirmed deleted. Legacy
  one-shot voice input remains compatible.

## 0.44.6

### Patch Changes

- 69bc207: Keep Codex history canonical across subscriptions and providers, separate optional owner-designated Codex Apps authority from inference allocation, and fence Apps authorization through each remote request.
- c0f8e40: Prevent model-visible GitHub installation credential exposure and duplicate brokered MCP side effects after ambiguous 401 responses.

## 0.44.3

### Patch Changes

- 4502474: Add workspace-default and explicitly personal ownership for first-party social connections, preserve causal personal authority for agent work, and retain actionable structured gateway errors.

## 0.44.0

### Minor Changes

- 664c1d8: Bound MCP OAuth setup with an absolute server deadline, abort stalled response streams, and preserve safe stage-specific API error details in SDK clients.

## 0.43.1

### Patch Changes

- c9d8b69: Make Connected Machine project paths portable and diagnosable: session responses now expose `workingDir`, and the native agent consistently supports the service user's `~` path across exec, filesystem, git, and terminal operations while reporting missing working directories accurately.

## 0.43.0

### Minor Changes

- bef5920: Add subject-scoped Workspace State preference and document-authority inventory
  metadata plus a canonical, explicitly sanitized export API and SDK method.

### Patch Changes

- b6e39fc: Polish session chrome and apply_patch rendering; clarify realtime voice-end handoff.

  SessionChrome gets denser selected-chip UX and Codex function-tool apply_patch shapes render in the specialized diff UI. Solo goal_continuation machine-input rows are suppressed in favor of the GoalRow landmark. The realtime transcript-tail instruction now keeps in-flight work going after voice ends.

## 0.42.1

### Patch Changes

- 4976e1c: Fix DNS-pinned OAuth response streaming under Bun and expose X as a built-in workspace social capability.

## 0.42.0

### Minor Changes

- fd13ba9: Add one immutable organization, workspace, or personal document destination contract for connector configuration, and make Google Drive persist and consume that authority independently from optional collections.

## 0.41.1

### Patch Changes

- abe0de6: Persist timesliced composer voice recordings in browser storage with reload-safe document ownership, opener/duplicate-tab fencing, oldest-first recovery, byte-ceiling enforcement, and durable transcript-before-draft handoff. Interrupted audio retries reuse the same recording, uncertain saved transcripts require explicit insertion instead of automatic retranscription or duplicate append, and transient handed-off cleanup failures are retried and garbage-collected owner-safely.

## 0.41.0

### Minor Changes

- 00f7d3b: Add durable, tenant-isolated onboarding proposals that atomically create inactive instruction-policy drafts with typed replay, stale-baseline, conflict, and audit contracts, plus a bounded Workspace State admin composer.

## 0.40.0

### Minor Changes

- b121e7c: Add durable Google Drive pause, resume, disconnect, reconnect, revoked-token,
  removed-app, and permission re-consent lifecycle handling with version-fenced
  state transitions, generation-bound disconnect idempotency, stale-replay
  protection, and secret-safe provider error classification.
- a49692d: Publish the provider-neutral realtime controller and the exact OpenGeni realtime composer experience at `@opengeni/sdk/realtime` and `@opengeni/react/realtime`, including proxy-friendly client contracts, batteries-included existing/new-session controls, and the public reference demo.

## 0.39.0

### Minor Changes

- b83af7a: Add replay-safe workspace instruction policy administration across the API,
  contracts, database, and SDK, including immutable operation receipts that reject
  changed requests reusing the same operation identifier.

## 0.38.0

### Minor Changes

- 1d0f2ae: Expose one effective document retrieval contract across REST, SDK, and MCP that binds the immutable initiating subject outside caller input, filters organization/workspace/personal authority before ranking, and preserves source plus authorization provenance in typed results.
- 3e4842d: Add subject-authorized accepted-attempt governance inspection to Workspace State,
  including immutable policy/preference snapshot metadata and deterministic current
  drift classification without exposing prompt or personal preference content.

## 0.37.0

### Minor Changes

- 13b961e: Add an atomic terminal session-subtree cancellation command that drains queued work, fences concurrent prompts and child creation, interrupts live attempts, durably reports cancelled children to surviving parents, and exposes the operation through the API/core/SDK control surface.
- e03397d: Freeze workspace instruction policies and structured preference descriptors at
  the accepted logical-turn boundary, add immutable per-session policy roles, and
  compose the resulting exact-attempt governance into agent and compaction prompts.
- 3baaebd: Add configurable Slack emoji-reaction summons with a least-privilege manifest, bounded thread context, and workspace-admin settings.

### Patch Changes

- 4f15920: Add an authorized, server-mediated connected-Codex GPT-Live V3 WebRTC SDP path with credential-safe negotiation and browser lifecycle helpers.

## 0.36.2

### Patch Changes

- e62495f: Allow session creators to explicitly opt out of a workspace default rig, and make live release acceptance prove its fixture command completed before waiting for a workspace capture.
- b4982fa: Expose GPT-5.6 Max reasoning end to end for managed and connected Codex models.

## 0.36.1

### Patch Changes

- 9c4d73d: Add curated OpenGeni-credit and workspace-key Vercel AI Gateway model paths for
  DeepSeek V4 Flash and Kimi K3, including exact provider routing, cache-aware
  pricing and metering, Responses tool continuity, provider-blind catalog UX, and
  stable remote-compaction cache prefixes.

## 0.36.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b3e46f: Allow a digest-pinned capability-pack sandbox image to bind an immutable Modal image ID. OpenGeni now preserves the logical OCI digest on the lease, starts the provider-native image through `ModalImageSelector.fromId`, records the actual ID in the Modal session envelope, clears lower-precedence IDs when a rig overrides the image, and keeps catalog image metadata aligned with the runtime manifest.

## 0.35.0

### Minor Changes

- dd71248: Make workspace-owned MCP OAuth connections the default, add explicit personal
  connection ownership, and preserve exact delegated personal authority across
  turns, child sessions, goals, schedules, retries, and recovery with safe
  tool-level degradation when a personal connection is unavailable.

## 0.34.1

### Patch Changes

- 408543f: Keep signed object-storage uploads credential-free so browser integrations can use provider CORS safely without sending ambient API or session credentials.

## 0.34.0

### Minor Changes

- ec0bc02: Add an opt-in browser analytics runtime contract with consent-gated, allowlisted
  Reo, PostHog, and GA4 provider configuration. Self-hosted deployments remain
  disabled by default, and public client configuration exposes no provider
  administrative credentials. Third-party modules load lazily, Reo clipboard/AI
  capture is disabled, query-bearing routes are excluded, and consent can be
  withdrawn without destabilizing the console.
- 5a4c559: Add first-party X and Reddit social connectors: OAuth connect flows (X PKCE
  S256, Reddit permanent grant) with encrypted token storage and just-in-time
  refresh, live first-party MCP tools (search, mentions, thread fetch, own-post
  sync, permission-gated reply publishing), a reddit provider in the marketing
  pack, operator config via OPENGENI_SOCIAL_OAUTH_CLIENTS_JSON, and SDK
  startSocialOAuth/listSocialConnections.

## 0.33.1

### Patch Changes

- 8243ffe: Allow browser SDK clients to call the public API from arbitrary origins with explicit bearer credentials while keeping cross-origin cookie sessions limited to operator-configured trusted origins.

## 0.33.0

### Minor Changes

- 1ec9912: Add generic, versioned workspace artifacts with content-addressed HTML storage, a static HTML/CSS renderer, rollback history, and first-party agent publishing tools. JavaScript and active or navigation-capable markup are removed from the initial renderer until executable artifacts have a stronger isolation boundary.

## 0.32.1

### Patch Changes

- c52acc0: Ship Fast latency mode with turn-column inheritance, Codex ChatGPT honor-skip for response service_tier, and model picker UX polish.

## 0.32.0

### Minor Changes

- f413e6c: Add real Workspace Insights: durable `model_call_facts` after authoritative
  `agent.model.usage`, a `workspace:admin` insights API over usage_events + facts +
  live joins, SDK client, and a web console that drops mock rollups for honest
  UTC credit/token/cache/warm/caps reporting.

## 0.31.0

### Minor Changes

- 42428a2: Add per-session Codex remote compaction v2 (`remote_v2` / `portable`), with UI landmarks, Codex-only model locking, and opaque token accounting aligned to Codex CLI.

### Patch Changes

- 0199108: Harden the workspace Slack bot with one fail-closed scope policy, deterministic legacy connection selection, and durable replay-safe message deletion operation identities.
- b2e975f: Advance the merged knowledge release train to fresh publication identities without changing runtime behavior. This corrective source is derived from current main and does not reuse generated release output.

## Unreleased

- Add native voice-input configuration mirrors, workspace toggle resolution, and one-shot multipart `transcribeAudio` uploads.

## 0.30.2

### Patch Changes

- 96eb64b: Advance the reviewed knowledge release package graph to fresh publishable identities after the previous version projection was invalidated. This changes release metadata only and does not alter runtime behavior.

## 0.30.1

### Patch Changes

- bbcbef5: Allow callers to cancel MCP OAuth-start requests so capability activation can fail visibly instead of spinning forever when browser transport stalls.
- ddff8db: Add the read-only Workspace State inventory with bounded, authorization-scoped
  Documents aggregates and a deterministic metadata-only Memory projection. The
  projection explicitly labels legacy `knowledge_memories` preference-kind counts
  as non-authoritative observations while preserving the structured preference
  registry as the sole active preference authority.

## 0.30.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f6f13f: Add the isolated, versioned organization/workspace/user preference registry,
  including audited proposal and activation flows, deterministic attempt-bound
  descriptors, authorized full-content retrieval, REST/MCP tools, and SDK types.
  Attempt reads revalidate current generation and immutable-human authority in one
  locked transaction; lifecycle writes use scope-version CAS and database-owned
  audit functions that prevent direct head mutation or history erasure. Snapshot
  creation is database-canonical and lifecycle governance requires a signed
  `human_session` principal; expiry filtering and supersession are transactionally
  enforced before bounds or terminal mutation.

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- 33dc88f: Restore managed GitHub App installation with OAuth-first existing-installation
  discovery, exact owner revalidation, and hosted/operator setup-mode separation.

## 0.28.3

### Patch Changes

- 28c678d: Publish the current session first-party MCP tool selection types under a new SDK version.
- 1c4018e: Replace one-turn tool overrides with one durable session tool policy, expose
  OpenGeni-native tools in the same selection, default available tools on, and
  render delivered machine inputs as compact typed timeline updates instead of
  raw protocol JSON.

## 0.28.2

### Patch Changes

- c1dcccc: Publish the current client surfaces from one exact reviewed source revision.

## 0.28.1

### Patch Changes

- 2ec6494: Publish the current client surfaces from one exact reviewed source revision.

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- 29ad09b: Persist typed machine inputs into canonical model history at turn claim, expose
  authoritative pending-input queue projections and lifecycle events, render
  delivered batches in the timeline, and preserve append-only prompt-cache
  prefixes across tools, later turns, recovery, and explicit compaction.

### Patch Changes

- 8eaa377: Expose transport-tolerant MCP output normalization from the SDK and reuse it in the React timeline parser.
- dfc3235: Separate first-party MCP authorization from exact per-session tool visibility, add fail-closed registration policy, and isolate file download URLs on the files MCP surface.

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 519d93c: Add validated inline per-session skills and discover skills directly from already-materialized repository resources.

## 0.26.3

### Patch Changes

- 110bb77: Enforce exact-subject ownership for personal OAuth capabilities and add secure direct OAuth installation for the separate workspace OpenGeni Slack bot.

## 0.26.1

### Patch Changes

- ffd246c: Keep workspace-capture Git status, diffs, and untracked files below provider retained-output limits, and publish an explicit degraded revision instead of an authoritative empty diff when repository reads fail.

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- 06a5801: Add the backend workspace instruction-policy revision, activation, rollback, audit, API, and SDK control surface.
- 5511c24: Add a secure workspace-shared OpenGeni Slack bot connection with schema-backed verified-install eligibility, immutable team/bot identity across reinstall, idempotent post-operation convergence, exact scope validation, first-party channel/history/user/post tools, explicit scheduled-task routing and rebinding, and install/reinstall/recovery UI and documentation.

## 0.25.5

### Patch Changes

- 9a8f793: Add fail-closed GitHub personal/organization owner authority proofs, audited
  workspace installation bindings with explicit repository allowlists, and
  truthful disabled/unbound/bound lifecycle contracts.
- c135339: Persist safe new-session defaults after successful creates while preserving explicit tool-policy semantics and revalidating stale workspace resources before reuse.

## 0.25.3

### Patch Changes

- a0f2442: Return typed correlation-safe API failures, discard bounded non-JSON gateway bodies in the SDK, preserve retryability and ambiguous mutation outcomes, and keep composer drafts stable across transient failures and live policy rerenders.

## 0.25.2

### Patch Changes

- 85cb323: Restore provider-native web search for workspace-default Codex sessions while preserving explicit
  tool narrowing, child policy ceilings, version-fenced policy adoption, and structured URL citations.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- 46bac05: Enforce a configurable inclusive nested-agent depth at the transactional
  session-creation boundary with a server default of three. Persist immutable
  lineage and policy snapshots, and return idempotent typed denial evidence without
  creating run, workflow, sandbox, usage, or billing artifacts.

### Patch Changes

- c549ed8: Persist and transactionally materialize revisioned active-goal continuation
  obligations, recover their Temporal delivery without human input or model
  polling, preserve authoritative human/Steer ordering, and expose truthful
  scheduled, running, blocked, and invariant-broken continuation state to clients.
  Make agent goal updates revisioned, attempt-recoverable commands so ambiguous
  commit responses reconcile without duplicate mutation or stale overwrites.
- 860de22: Persist actor-private pre-session drafts on the server, consume only the exact accepted revision after durable session initialization, return structured create errors, deduplicate create resources, derive checksums for SDK uploads, restore finalized attachments without browser-local byte authority, and preserve attachments added while an earlier send is in flight.
- 5b57a2d: Make provisioned-sandbox recovery truthful and atomic. Provider existence,
  lease liveness, route attachment, archive availability, restore progress,
  verified workspace readiness, and epochs are exposed separately; attach/swap
  must certify readiness. Definitive provider loss is exact-instance fenced,
  concurrent observers receive typed recovery/superseded outcomes, and ambiguous
  operations are never replayed. Rematerialization selects one verified archive
  revision under the lease lock, verifies archive bytes and restored tree contents,
  and fails closed as degraded or unrecoverable instead of publishing a partial,
  mixed, previous, or clean fallback workspace.

  Unify every persistable workspace mutation under durable turn, API-direct, or
  retained-process authority. Direct requests use exact request UUID holders;
  yielded processes retain their parent admission and exact pinned provider/route
  identity until durable exit/loss settlement. Direct/process authority blocks
  archive capture, process stdin receives a distinct mutation admission, and PTY
  control cannot be rerouted by active-pointer movement.

  Make terminal execution physically synchronous: `terminalExec` always returns a
  numeric `exitCode` with `running: false`, and timeout/error paths return only
  after exact process-group absence and retained settlement. Interactive PTYs open
  only after durable promotion, close only on exact terminal proof, and report
  provider loss truthfully.

  Activate the generation/process schema through maintenance migration 0117. All
  old API/control/turn writers must stop before the one-way cutover and may not
  restart afterward; archive completeness requires the exact closed generation.

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- 0ed0f01: Add per-member session pin preferences with isolated server persistence, bounded/reused stable
  pagination snapshots, snapshot-free pin polling, typed SDK and React reconciliation, and accessible
  list and header controls.

### Patch Changes

- 744a93d: Add default-off, bounded adaptive Codex fleet decision telemetry with strict deterministic replay, cache-aware and work-conserving policy simulation, secret-safe event/UI observability, and independent future policy gates.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d60720: Add capability-first session tool policies with omission-as-discovery defaults,
  explicit per-turn narrowing and child inheritance, secret-safe effective-policy
  projections, stable lazy `tool_search` catalogs, and matching API, SDK, React,
  worker, embedding, and audit contracts.

  Harden credential-bearing MCP and OAuth traffic with destination-bound
  credentials, single-resolution DNS-pinned transport, bounded catalogs, schemas,
  results, request and response bodies, and independently validated manual
  redirects. Extend renewable, session-bound Toolspace access to connected
  machines while dynamically fencing every call to the session's active attempt.

### Patch Changes

- bdd531c: Make Codex subscription response timeouts recoverable without blindly replaying partially observed model work. The transport now assigns a durable request identity, records attempt-fenced start/headers/first-byte/terminal metadata, enforces explicit headers, stream-idle, and whole-request deadlines, and retries once only before any response is observed. Exhausted or partial-stream timeouts retain a typed failure class and return the durable session to its existing retryable recovery path instead of hard-failing it with the opaque OpenAI SDK `Request timed out.` error. External cancellation remains authoritative, the SDK retry budget remains disabled, and Codex subscription turns keep their existing zero-credit billing path.
- 3214d70: Materialize the linked SDK and React model-provider readiness APIs from a fresh immutable release revision.

## 0.22.1

### Patch Changes

- 524599e: Normalize model, provider, upstream deployment, credential source, billing,
  capability, health, and pricing identity; expose a secret-safe authenticated
  workspace catalog with separate fail-closed credential readiness for federated
  providers; and persist the accepted model/reasoning execution policy on new
  logical turns.

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 229902b: Add trustworthy per-subscription Codex quota/reset-credit overview and allocator OCC controls, plus an owning-human managed-cookie-only reset redemption flow with durable ambiguity-safe provider idempotency.

## 0.21.2

### Patch Changes

- 4966649: Add bounded authoritative terminal-result projections to session event monitoring APIs and SDK types.

## 0.21.1

### Patch Changes

- ff23da5: Keep oversized event previews bounded while optionally linking them to integrity-addressed workspace-file evidence, and expose access-controlled metadata plus capped provider-native range retrieval through the API and SDK.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- d1dee7a: Let embedding hosts read and update an existing session MCP server's approval
  policy through the public API, SDK, and React session hook. Each claimed
  attempt freezes its policy under the session lock, so updates affect the next
  attempt without reinterpreting work already running; model MCP and
  Toolspace/Code Mode consume the same exact snapshot. Toolspace tokens and
  side-effect receipts bind every proxied call to the exact active attempt, so
  Pause, Steer, recovery, and late outputs preserve one authoritative owner.

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 9f84cc9: Add durable host-provided per-turn instructions, headless structured-input hooks, host-local queue
  focus, and reusable approval and human-input surfaces for embedded session consumers.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 136227e: Add an immutable, versioned curated skill library with explicit workspace selection and inspectable provenance, and preserve WCAG AA contrast for dark-theme primary actions.
- 3aee519: Add a workspace-accepted, provider-agnostic transcription policy and host-adapter contract, plus an accessible composer microphone that keeps partials ephemeral and appends non-empty accepted finals to the editable draft exactly once. Policies explicitly accept automatic language detection and speaker diarization, events can carry strict neutral result metadata, pending starts and cleanup are abortable/bounded, and adapter failures stay behind controlled UI copy with redacted non-UI diagnostics.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 4401ce7: Add a scope-checked host MCP credential resolver to the public embedding port and use it consistently for model-visible MCP tools and Toolspace/Code Mode while preserving the standalone connection broker as the default. Requests carry both the immediate session and its workspace-scoped lineage root so embedded hosts can authorize child sessions through one durable root binding. Provider-neutral bindings now carry a provider family, provider host, opaque host binding id, and exact selected-repository set; successful credentials must echo the complete binding before headers are accepted. Incompatible endpoint authentication and unenforceable resource containment surface as explicit unavailable states instead of starting a duplicate OpenGeni provider connection.
- c389adc: Add a provider-neutral host run-credential port with frozen turn/session lineage,
  off-manifest environment and file generations, proactive renewal, attempt-safe
  cleanup with bounded generation retention, output redaction hints, and structured
  reconnect UI support. Hosts can explicitly opt a frozen target out, and the
  POSIX materializer supports both Linux `flock` and a portable directory-lock
  fallback with cross-platform base64 decoding.
- d249403: Allow embedding hosts to preallocate a session UUID before OpenGeni admits the
  initial turn. Session creation preserves idempotent replays of the same UUID and
  returns a conflict for UUID reuse or an idempotency replay that changes identity.
  The additive create response also returns `initialTurnId`, so an embedding host
  can correlate a preallocated host run without misusing the nullable
  `activeTurnId` execution pointer.
- a11a7fc: Support mixed GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps repositories—including multiple
  accounts or installations for one provider—in a single session through bounded,
  host-opaque credential bindings and optional read/write access intent.

  Validate binding/provider/host echoes before token injection, isolate tokens in
  hashed binding files, select Git credentials by remote path, fail provider CLIs
  closed on ambiguous bindings, and renew each binding independently while keeping
  legacy one-binding-per-provider request and file aliases compatible.

- dda6398: Add durable structured human-input tool calls with exact-turn ownership,
  answer/skip/expiry/cancellation outcomes, restart-safe Temporal resumption,
  authorized API and SDK methods, and headless plus styled React embed surfaces.
- e8ca4f6: Let trusted embedding hosts sign a service-only causal initiator separately
  from the delegated subject that authorizes a create, Send, or Steer command.
  Freeze that service and its non-secret provenance onto the new session/turn,
  while rejecting human impersonation, exact agent-attempt replacement, reserved
  lineage fields, the legacy migration sentinel, and oversized provenance.
  Service-provenance HTTP tokens use a prefix-bound `ogd2_` envelope so older
  rolling-deploy verifiers fail closed instead of silently stripping attribution.
- 736f4fe: Persist and expose one immutable subject-or-service initiator for every accepted turn, including creator-safe idempotent repair, queue-edit preservation, exact live-attempt fencing for agent-created sessions, signed agent inheritance, causally dominant Agent Steer attribution, explicit service producers, rolling legacy backfill, and database-enforced immutability.
  Bounded agent provenance now retains its first causal hop together with the
  newest hops, so deep child chains do not discard their root authority when the
  middle of the audit path is truncated.

### Patch Changes

- 1fcd83d: Make repository mount paths provider-neutral and collision-free. Omitted paths
  now resolve to a canonical host-aware default that distinguishes GitHub,
  GitLab, Azure DevOps, and custom hosts, while one shared portable-path validator
  rejects traversal and case-folded collisions before sandbox execution.

  Hosts upgrading sessions persisted without `mountPath` should expect those
  repositories to materialize at the new host-aware location. To preserve an
  existing warm workspace location, stamp the session's former effective
  `repos/<owner>/<repo>` path explicitly before upgrading. Previously accepted
  explicit paths that are non-portable or collide after Unicode normalization and
  case folding now fail validation and must be renamed.

- 51f45a3: Publish the session-only React entry point and typed session control surface in a stable registry release.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- dbb6232: Support linking an existing GitHub App installation to multiple OpenGeni workspaces with independent repository allowlists.

  - Discover installations through GitHub App user OAuth, require repository-level administrator permission, and configure the OAuth callback in generated App manifests.
  - Persist workspace-scoped installation bindings and repository selections while retaining legacy `all` bindings for compatibility.
  - Enforce the current binding during repository listing, session admission, MCP token minting, and GitHub-authenticated worker turn startup.
  - Add SDK and web controls to link, rescope, and unlink a workspace without uninstalling the GitHub App or affecting another workspace.

### Patch Changes

- bb09be8: Add a session-only React entrypoint and mirror MCP approval policy in
  the public SDK type.
- Bound model-facing tool output, complete input accounting, compact session discovery,
  event and realtime projections, authorized evidence retrieval, and compaction failure
  convergence with explicit truncation and loss metadata throughout the output lifecycle.
  Session event `latest` lookups are now class-exclusive across REST, MCP, and SDK clients.
  Updated-order session discovery now uses a transactional workspace activity-revision fence,
  and the workspace-control bounds migration rewrites only historical cap violations.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- ec0697a: Ship the production-hardened captured workspace workbench, physically verified Steer/Pause cancellation across cloud, local, and self-hosted model tools, pre-model preparation, sandbox provisioning, and lifecycle/setup commands, durable quiescence admission fencing, cancellation-aware SDK reads and turn cleanup, single-round-trip pruned workspace indexing, truthful shutdown states, a responsive and accessible review dock, Unicode coverage, and package-safe CSS/SSR integration.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- f42cd4a: Replace the old queue and interruption surface with one revisioned prompt queue, durable composer drafts, atomic Steer, recursive Pause/Resume, workspace control invalidation, stale-client contract fencing, and a shared accessible queue UI for first- and third-party consumers. Remove the obsolete passive child-notification setting so every child terminal result follows the one bounded, coalescible internal-update contract.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 0805620: Make active-sandbox pointer swaps establishment-safe. A swap or create-time seed to a target no turn can establish (a non-group Modal sibling, or an unknown backend kind) is now rejected before the epoch-fenced pointer commit with a typed rejection `code`, leaving the pointer and epoch untouched. At turn start a persisted pointer whose target is structurally unestablishable (a deleted sandbox row, a Modal sibling, or an enrollment-less selfhosted row) is reset to the session home under the epoch fence and announced with a new `session.route.reconciled` event, honoring a concurrent higher-epoch swap rather than clobbering it. A null pointer resolves to the session home backend, and the routing proxy's per-op cache is keyed on the full `(activeEpoch, activeSandboxId)` tuple so a clear-to-null re-lands the next op on home rather than a stale swapped-to session. Adds the optional `SwapActiveSandboxResponse.code` discriminant and the `session.route.reconciled` session event type to the public contracts and SDK wire types.
- b804fd4: Add provider-neutral git credential contracts and runtime sandbox token-file seeding for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. Sandboxes now provision `gh`, `glab`, and `az` wrappers that read current token files at invocation time without storing token values in manifests.
- e4d3569: Add per-member workspace session pins with stable pinned-first listing, subject-scoped FORCE-RLS persistence, snapshot-backed activity pagination, optimistic OCC-safe pin/unpin updates, and accessible responsive web controls.

### Patch Changes

- ad4502a: Make the workbench and console dependency-safe, keep list identities stable, preserve caught error causes, isolate desktop consent tests from real transports, and enforce warning-free repository lint plus aggregate React tests in CI.
- 04d7595: Discover repositories at any workspace nesting depth, including linked worktrees whose `.git` marker is a file, while pruning dependency/build residue and enforcing timeout and repository-count bounds. An incomplete discovery now persists an epoch-fenced degraded capture revision, announces its typed reason, and makes clients prefer live workspace data instead of presenting a misleading empty capture.
- faf1487: Add workspace-local, holder-fenced Codex subscription leases with deterministic
  fairness across worker replicas, explicit allocator eligibility, and
  failure-classified same-turn failover. All-exhausted active goals now persist one
  generation- and policy-fenced capacity waiter, wake from authoritative reset
  timers or revisioned capacity mutations, survive Temporal restart and
  continue-as-new, and enqueue at most one normal continuation without synthetic
  user messages, full-turn replay, provider/model rewriting, or automatic
  entitlement redemption.

  Expose a generic accepted-turn policy-scope and per-scope unavailable-diagnostic
  seam for future named pools while resolving exact live/frozen same-turn reuse
  before membership filtering. Preserve manual versus policy pin semantics and
  session-sharded cache affinity without moving an in-flight lease or the legacy
  workspace pointer for policy homes.

- 4a25bfc: Add the `machine.link.lost`, `machine.link.restored`, and `machine.runner.restarted` session-event types for Connected Machine control-link observability (the failure-visibility doctrine's link plane). These are session-scoped, announce-only diagnostics fanned out only to the sessions that had an active op running on the machine when its control link changed — never to idle or historical sessions. A clean going-offline emits `machine.link.lost` (plus `machine.runner.restarted` when the reason is a self-update restart), and a reconnect Hello that actually cleared a going-offline marker emits `machine.link.restored`. All three project to the timeline's quiet tier (no rendered item) and are mirrored in the SDK event-type list. Adds the `sessionsWithActiveOpOnEnrollment` DB helper (one indexed lookup, no per-op tracking table) that resolves the fan-out target set.
- 3148404: Add the `machine.op.failed` and `machine.op.recovered` session-event types for Connected Machine op-outcome observability (the failure-visibility doctrine's out-of-band plane). These are session-scoped, announce-only diagnostics: `machine.op.failed` fires for infrastructure fault classes only (offline, draining-exhausted, payload-too-large, reconnecting-timeout, OS/stream/protocol) — never for a semantic miss the model asked about (a missing path, a consent gate, a nonzero exit); `machine.op.recovered` is the quiet healed-fault leading indicator. Both project to the timeline's quiet tier (no rendered item), mirrored in the SDK event-type list.
- a5f58f9: Make "stop" mean stop, and stop the child-completion flood from outrunning it.

  - **Stop drains the queue.** A non-steer interrupt now cancels the active turn AND all queued turns, emitting one `turn.queue_drained` summary event. Steer still promotes exactly one steered message.
  - **A user-paused goal is sacred.** A machine child-completion turn can no longer re-activate a goal the user paused (`goal_set` is refused for such callers), and the wake text drops the "resume it now" nudge when the manager's own goal is user-paused. The caller is classified by its own signed turn identity (a new `turnId` claim on the first-party MCP token), not the session's live active pointer — so the guard cannot be raced into refusing a legitimate human `goal_set`.
  - **Child-completion notifications coalesce.** N spawned workers reaching terminal states now fold into ONE queued digest turn (one model run) instead of N turns, so the flood can no longer outrun a human's stop button. Each worker still gets its own result card.
  - **Human messages preempt machine notifications.** A person's message jumps ahead of any queued child-completion notification turns (behind the running turn and earlier human turns) — it never waits behind a flood of "worker FAILED" notices.
  - **Child-completion suppression opt-in.** A new first-party `set_child_notifications_mode` tool lets a manager switch spawned-worker completions to `passive`: they appear as timeline cards only and never queue a turn or a model run. `digest` remains the default.
  - **Honest steering copy.** The composer no longer claims steer "injects this message now"; it cancels the current step and runs the message next while the goal continues, and the stop button says it clears queued messages and pauses the goal.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 602db89: Add Toolspace programmatic tool access for sandboxes.

  The new `toolspace:call` permission is an explicit, session-bound delegated grant for sandbox code. When `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_ENABLED=true`, worker turns mint a narrow `ogd_` token to a sandbox token file and expose `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL`; the first-party MCP route uses that token to compose the session's safe first-party, capability-backed, and per-session MCP tools, with approval-required tools denied as MCP `isError` results.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 7bfe593: Surface the desktop-capture-blocked reason as server-visible enrollment state.

  A machine can have a display it cannot CAPTURE (macOS Screen Recording / TCC not granted). The agent's connect Hello already withholds the desktop cell in that case; this persists a human, actionable reason alongside it so the Machines dashboard / VM picker can render "display: capture not granted" instead of a bare `display_unavailable`.

  - **Contracts / SDK**: `MachineView` (and `EnrollmentSummary`) gain an additive, nullable `desktopUnavailableReason`. Non-null only when a display exists but capture is blocked; `null` == capture permitted OR genuinely headless. Absent/`null` ⇒ byte-identical to today's shape for existing consumers.
  - **DB**: new nullable `enrollments.desktop_unavailable_reason` column (no backfill — `NULL` preserves the existing "capture-permitted or headless" semantics). The display-cursor writer now persists `has_display` AND the reason together, change-guarded on either field, and self-heals to `null` on the next Hello once the grant is restored.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- e513236: Add an optional per-session `instructions` field to `CreateSessionRequest`: a first-class, system-level agent persona lever composed AFTER the per-workspace `agentInstructions` (session-specific last, non-bypassable CORE preserved). It is org-visible session metadata (returned on the session record) but is never emitted as a timeline event, so hosts can deliver per-agent-type prompts without leaking prompt content into the user-visible timeline or weakening instruction authority. Absent ⇒ byte-identical to today's composition.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 3d708b5: Add compact event replay support for history windows and switch React session-event loading to capped compact pages with coalesced-delta resume cursors.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 15deca0: Add per-session third-party MCP servers with write-only encrypted headers, metadata-only responses/events, `mcp_servers:attach` permission gating, and per-message credential rotation.
- 5e56bcd: Add tail-first session event loading with reverse durable pagination, older-history loading controls, and timeline props for smooth prepend pagination.

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 5962dd0: Republish the closure so published manifests reference `@opengeni/contracts@^0.4.0`. The previous `^0.3.0` ranges exclude 0.4.0 under 0.x caret semantics, causing consumers to nest a stale contracts copy that lacks the current export surface.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a4f370f: Carve the connected-machine UI into a dedicated `@opengeni/react/machines` subpath, and add `workingDir` to the SDK create-session request.

  - **`@opengeni/react`**: the bring-your-own-compute surface (`useMachines`, `MachinesDashboard`, `MachineCard`, `MachineDockBar`, `SharedMachineDisclosure`, `MachineStatusPill`, `ConnectionStatusPill`, `ConnectionDot`, `MachineMetrics`, `EnrollmentDeviceFlow`, `EnrollmentConsent`, `connectionStatusForState`, and the `MachineView` / `MachineState` / `MachineKind` / `MachinesResponse` / `MetricSample` view-model types) now lives at `@opengeni/react/machines`. The root keeps re-exporting it for backwards compatibility — **non-breaking** — but the root re-export is **deprecated** and will move in a future major. Import from `@opengeni/react/machines` going forward.
  - **`@opengeni/sdk`**: `CreateSessionRequest` gains an optional `workingDir?: string` field — the host working directory for a connected-machine target (the agent runs there; defaults to the machine's launch dir). Ignored for managed sandboxes.

- d9d7743: Render the self-hosted desktop stream: a PNG-frame canvas client for `transport: "relay-frames"`.

  Self-hosted machines stream their desktop as PNG-per-frame protobuf datagrams over the relay (not RFB), so the noVNC/RFB viewer could never render them — the desktop went "warm" but the live stream never came up. This adds `useRelayFrameStream`, a view-only canvas renderer that opens the relay channel, decodes each PNG frame, and paints it (latest-wins backpressure so a slow decode never queues). `useDesktopStream` now dispatches on `DesktopStream.transport`: `"vnc-ws"` → noVNC (Modal boxes), `"relay-frames"` → the frame renderer (self-hosted machines). The `DesktopStream.transport` / `client` unions gain `"relay-frames"` / `"frames"`. View-only in v1 (matches the machine's read-only mode); interactive input is a follow-up.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 48c0d2e: Add session titles. A session now has a short display title that the agent generates itself: on the genesis turn a hidden, non-persisted directive asks the agent to call the new `set_session_title` tool, so the session is named on its own model with no extra LLM call. Users (and agents with `sessions:control`, via `set_other_session_title`) can rename; a user-set title is permanent and is never clobbered by agent writes.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: `Session.title` / `Session.titleSource`, `UpdateSessionRequest`, and the `session.title_set` event.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: `client.updateSession(workspaceId, sessionId, { title })`.
  - `@opengeni/react`: `useSession().updateTitle(...)`, live `session.title_set` handling, and `sessionDisplayTitle` now prefers `session.title`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a1c82c5: Add the world-class timeline tool-call renderer module and the sandbox workspace client surface to `@opengeni/react`.

  - **Timeline renderers**: per-tool disclosure cards (full-row toggle, keyboard-accessible), screenshots → lightbox, theme-aware Pierre diffs, turn-collapse summary chips, sub-agent worker/goal landmarks, a consumer-extensible tool registry, and complete state handling (running / complete / failed / cancelled), each with its own affordance.
  - **Sandbox surfacing**: file/terminal/git/desktop hooks and components (`useSandboxFiles`, `useSandboxTerminal`, `useSandboxGit`, `useDesktopStream`, `useTerminalStream`, `useSessionCapabilities`, `SandboxFiles`, `SandboxTerminal`, `DesktopViewer`, `WorkspaceDock`, Pierre diff/file views, `CodeEditor`).

  All additive; `MessageTimeline`'s `items` contract is unchanged. The internal `compactPayloadPreview` helper was removed from the public surface.

### Patch Changes

- 2989163: Add a `deleteDocument` client helper for removing documents from document bases.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- a78a09b: Publish the SDK source that adds `OpenGeniClient.getClientConfig()` (returns `ClientConfig`). The method was added to the source but never republished, while `@opengeni/react@0.3.0` already depends on it — so react@0.3.0 consumers could not typecheck against the published sdk@0.2.0. Released as a patch so it stays within react@0.3.0's `^0.2.0` range.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 21c1535: Initial public release of the OpenGeni client packages.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: shared zod wire-contract schemas and types.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: zero-dependency, framework-agnostic TypeScript client with typed API, session lifecycle, and SSE streaming (reconnect + replay-by-sequence).
  - `@opengeni/react`: React hooks and styled components built on `@opengeni/sdk`.

  All three now ship ESM + `.d.ts` builds via tsup and are published to npm with provenance.
