## 0.7.3

### Patch Changes

- b9dbb63: Keep failed-child result provenance owned by the atomic turn settlement. Worker activities now read and deliver the exact committed outbox row without rewriting its turn-scoped payload or lineage.

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [6882ff2]
  - @opengeni/codex@0.2.3
  - @opengeni/config@0.5.1

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- ea52b39: Recover retryable provider failures as new fenced attempts of the same accepted turn, independent of goal state, while preserving durable tool history and pause controls.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- a0cb58f: Streaming exec to Connected Machines over the op-stream protocol (server half).
  When a runner advertises the `op_stream` capability (persisted from its connect
  Hello onto the enrollment) and `OPENGENI_AGENT_OP_STREAM_ENABLED` is on
  (default off), selfhosted exec streams as sequenced, acked, credit-flowed
  frames: no reply-size wall (retention-bounded, typed on overflow), blip-proof
  collection (re-attach + replay, blake3-verified byte-exact), and idempotent
  starts keyed by a durable per-tool-call op id so a re-dispatched turn attaches
  to the already-running command instead of re-running it. The legacy monolithic
  exec remains the permanent fallback wire form. The events bus gains an
  op-stream subscribe/publish accessor on the same managed NATS connection.

### Patch Changes

- 332ac15: Add workspace-scoped operator session-revival admission helpers and pending-work guards for safe control-plane recovery tooling.
- ad4502a: Make the workbench and console dependency-safe, keep list identities stable, preserve caught error causes, isolate desktop consent tests from real transports, and enforce warning-free repository lint plus aggregate React tests in CI.
- 477b2bb: Add a "sharded" codex rotation strategy: session-sharded account affinity. Each session is assigned a deterministic HOME account (`hash(sessionId) % healthy-accounts`) at its first codex turn, written as a `policy` pin (a new `sessions.codex_pin_source` discriminator distinguishes it from a user's `manual` pin). A session stays on its one home account for prompt-cache warmth while load spreads ~1/N across the pool.

  Both rotation guards (proactive turn-start and reactive 429) now allow a `policy`-pinned session to rebalance when its account caps — never a `manual` pin, which stays sacred. A rebalance durably REWRITES the session pin (re-sharding over the healthy survivors so capped-account cohorts spread instead of re-concentrating on one failover) rather than moving only the workspace active pointer, because credential selection returns a pinned account with no exhaustion check.

  Pin lifecycle: a `manual` pin is honored under every strategy; a `policy` pin is meaningful only while the sharded policy is active. When a workspace runs a non-sharded strategy (or rotation is disabled), a leftover policy pin is ignored and lazily cleared on the session's next turn — so the session converges to the active strategy instead of idling on a capped ex-home. The strategy is selectable alongside `most_remaining`/`round_robin`/`drain_then_next` via the existing rotation-settings API; unpinned behavior under the other strategies is unchanged.

- 04d7595: Discover repositories at any workspace nesting depth, including linked worktrees whose `.git` marker is a file, while pruning dependency/build residue and enforcing timeout and repository-count bounds. An incomplete discovery now persists an epoch-fenced degraded capture revision, announces its typed reason, and makes clients prefer live workspace data instead of presenting a misleading empty capture.
- 0805620: Make active-sandbox pointer swaps establishment-safe. A swap or create-time seed to a target no turn can establish (a non-group Modal sibling, or an unknown backend kind) is now rejected before the epoch-fenced pointer commit with a typed rejection `code`, leaving the pointer and epoch untouched. At turn start a persisted pointer whose target is structurally unestablishable (a deleted sandbox row, a Modal sibling, or an enrollment-less selfhosted row) is reset to the session home under the epoch fence and announced with a new `session.route.reconciled` event, honoring a concurrent higher-epoch swap rather than clobbering it. A null pointer resolves to the session home backend, and the routing proxy's per-op cache is keyed on the full `(activeEpoch, activeSandboxId)` tuple so a clear-to-null re-lands the next op on home rather than a stale swapped-to session. Adds the optional `SwapActiveSandboxResponse.code` discriminant and the `session.route.reconciled` session event type to the public contracts and SDK wire types.
- faf1487: Add workspace-local, holder-fenced Codex subscription leases with deterministic
  fairness across worker replicas, explicit allocator eligibility, and
  failure-classified same-turn failover. All-exhausted active goals now persist one
  generation- and policy-fenced capacity waiter, wake from authoritative reset
  timers or revisioned capacity mutations, survive Temporal restart and
  continue-as-new, and enqueue at most one normal continuation without synthetic
  user messages, full-turn replay, provider/model rewriting, or automatic
  entitlement redemption.

  Expose a generic accepted-turn policy-scope and per-scope unavailable-diagnostic
  seam for future named pools while resolving exact live/frozen same-turn reuse
  before membership filtering. Preserve manual versus policy pin semantics and
  session-sharded cache affinity without moving an in-flight lease or the legacy
  workspace pointer for policy homes.

- 13d0889: Allow independent sessions to persist attempt-fenced work concurrently while preserving an exclusive workspace Pause boundary, and align the durable control constraint with workspace Pause.
- b804fd4: Add provider-neutral git credential contracts and runtime sandbox token-file seeding for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. Sandboxes now provision `gh`, `glab`, and `az` wrappers that read current token files at invocation time without storing token values in manifests.
- 4a25bfc: Connected Machines read OFFLINE immediately on a clean going-offline. When a machine announces a typed GoingOffline (user-stop / self-update / host-shutdown) it now records a nullable `went_offline_at` + `went_offline_reason` marker on its enrollment, and the liveness derivation gives an un-cleared marker precedence over last_seen aging AND over a lingering liveness probe — so the dashboard and any work-routing decision see the machine as offline right away instead of waiting out the dead-detect window. A lifecycle `revoked` status still trumps the marker, and any newer liveness signal (a reconnect Hello or a fresher heartbeat) clears it back to null. Adds the `setEnrollmentWentOffline` and `clearEnrollmentWentOffline` DB helpers, threads the marker onto `EnrollmentRecord` and the `selfhostedLiveness` input, and clears it inside `touchEnrollmentLastSeen`.
- 4a25bfc: Add the `machine.link.lost`, `machine.link.restored`, and `machine.runner.restarted` session-event types for Connected Machine control-link observability (the failure-visibility doctrine's link plane). These are session-scoped, announce-only diagnostics fanned out only to the sessions that had an active op running on the machine when its control link changed — never to idle or historical sessions. A clean going-offline emits `machine.link.lost` (plus `machine.runner.restarted` when the reason is a self-update restart), and a reconnect Hello that actually cleared a going-offline marker emits `machine.link.restored`. All three project to the timeline's quiet tier (no rendered item) and are mirrored in the SDK event-type list. Adds the `sessionsWithActiveOpOnEnrollment` DB helper (one indexed lookup, no per-op tracking table) that resolves the fan-out target set.
- e4d3569: Add per-member workspace session pins with stable pinned-first listing, subject-scoped FORCE-RLS persistence, snapshot-backed activity pagination, optimistic OCC-safe pin/unpin updates, and accessible responsive web controls.
- 810542f: Commit workspace capture announcements atomically with their revision rows and keep harmless late capture bookkeeping out of the user timeline.
- 5942493: Repair missing file-upload usage records on idempotent finalize retries, reclaim abandoned direct-upload objects through a fenced Temporal cleanup schedule, and preserve accessible provider-backed image previews across reloads.
- a5f58f9: Make "stop" mean stop, and stop the child-completion flood from outrunning it.

  - **Stop drains the queue.** A non-steer interrupt now cancels the active turn AND all queued turns, emitting one `turn.queue_drained` summary event. Steer still promotes exactly one steered message.
  - **A user-paused goal is sacred.** A machine child-completion turn can no longer re-activate a goal the user paused (`goal_set` is refused for such callers), and the wake text drops the "resume it now" nudge when the manager's own goal is user-paused. The caller is classified by its own signed turn identity (a new `turnId` claim on the first-party MCP token), not the session's live active pointer — so the guard cannot be raced into refusing a legitimate human `goal_set`.
  - **Child-completion notifications coalesce.** N spawned workers reaching terminal states now fold into ONE queued digest turn (one model run) instead of N turns, so the flood can no longer outrun a human's stop button. Each worker still gets its own result card.
  - **Human messages preempt machine notifications.** A person's message jumps ahead of any queued child-completion notification turns (behind the running turn and earlier human turns) — it never waits behind a flood of "worker FAILED" notices.
  - **Child-completion suppression opt-in.** A new first-party `set_child_notifications_mode` tool lets a manager switch spawned-worker completions to `passive`: they appear as timeline cards only and never queue a turn or a model run. `digest` remains the default.
  - **Honest steering copy.** The composer no longer claims steer "injects this message now"; it cancels the current step and runs the message next while the goal continues, and the stop button says it clears queued messages and pauses the goal.

- 9d4283d: Per-workspace model/provider hard-block policy. A new `workspace_model_policies` table (NULL = unrestricted) lets a workspace strictly allowlist which providers and/or exact model ids may serve its turns. Enforced twice: a 422 at every API model choke point (user message, queued-turn update, scheduled task, and session creation — where the EFFECTIVE model, `payload.model ?? deployment default`, is vetted, since an omitted model stamps the deployment default onto the session), and authoritatively in the worker immediately after turn model resolution, where a blocked provider/model throws `WorkspaceModelPolicyBlockedError` before any model call — including the legacy null-resolution fallback to the built-in OpenAI/Azure client, which is attributed to the built-in's own provider id so blocking the built-in also closes that path. Goal continuations that inherit a blocked model recover to the session's allowed default or pause the goal visibly with a truthful rationale. New `GET/PUT /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/model-policy` routes (read / admin) manage the policy. Workspaces without a policy row behave exactly as before. This exists so a codex-subscription workspace can be fail-closed to codex: a turn may wait or fail loud, but can never fall through to a paid provider.

  - @opengeni/config@0.4.0

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 602db89: Add Toolspace programmatic tool access for sandboxes.

  The new `toolspace:call` permission is an explicit, session-bound delegated grant for sandbox code. When `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_ENABLED=true`, worker turns mint a narrow `ogd_` token to a sandbox token file and expose `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL`; the first-party MCP route uses that token to compose the session's safe first-party, capability-backed, and per-session MCP tools, with approval-required tools denied as MCP `isError` results.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 7bfe593: Surface the desktop-capture-blocked reason as server-visible enrollment state.

  A machine can have a display it cannot CAPTURE (macOS Screen Recording / TCC not granted). The agent's connect Hello already withholds the desktop cell in that case; this persists a human, actionable reason alongside it so the Machines dashboard / VM picker can render "display: capture not granted" instead of a bare `display_unavailable`.

  - **Contracts / SDK**: `MachineView` (and `EnrollmentSummary`) gain an additive, nullable `desktopUnavailableReason`. Non-null only when a display exists but capture is blocked; `null` == capture permitted OR genuinely headless. Absent/`null` ⇒ byte-identical to today's shape for existing consumers.
  - **DB**: new nullable `enrollments.desktop_unavailable_reason` column (no backfill — `NULL` preserves the existing "capture-permitted or headless" semantics). The display-cursor writer now persists `has_display` AND the reason together, change-guarded on either field, and self-heals to `null` on the next Hello once the grant is restored.

### Patch Changes

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- e513236: Add an optional per-session `instructions` field to `CreateSessionRequest`: a first-class, system-level agent persona lever composed AFTER the per-workspace `agentInstructions` (session-specific last, non-bypassable CORE preserved). It is org-visible session metadata (returned on the session record) but is never emitted as a timeline event, so hosts can deliver per-agent-type prompts without leaking prompt content into the user-visible timeline or weakening instruction authority. Absent ⇒ byte-identical to today's composition.
