# @opengeni/observability

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ac924ca: Fix Modal private-registry sandbox image handling for embedded deployments and republish the observability API surface.

  Modal registry Secrets are resolved through the authenticated OpenGeni Modal client, and Modal private-registry images are now warmed at turn time for pack-scoped sandbox images, not only at worker boot for the deployment-global image ref.

  `@opengeni/observability` is minor-bumped so the already-source-shipped `setGauge`, `incrementCounter`, `observeHistogram`, and `debug` methods are available to external consumers. The published direct dependents are patch-bumped so their 0.x caret ranges resolve to the new observability minor in a coherent install.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 5962dd0: Republish the closure so published manifests reference `@opengeni/contracts@^0.4.0`. The previous `^0.3.0` ranges exclude 0.4.0 under 0.x caret semantics, causing consumers to nest a stale contracts copy that lacks the current export surface.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2170732: Publish the full Stage C `@opengeni/*` runtime closure to npm so external hosts can consume OpenGeni from published packages instead of vendored workspace tarballs.

  The release pipeline now builds every publishable package, rewrites every published `workspace:*` dependency to a concrete semver range, rewrites source entry points to dist entry points for every publishable package, and leaves only leaf-only non-runtime packages ignored.
