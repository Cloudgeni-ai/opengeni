### Patch Changes

- 332ac15: Add workspace-scoped operator session-revival admission helpers and pending-work guards for safe control-plane recovery tooling.
- 0805620: Make active-sandbox pointer swaps establishment-safe. A swap or create-time seed to a target no turn can establish (a non-group Modal sibling, or an unknown backend kind) is now rejected before the epoch-fenced pointer commit with a typed rejection `code`, leaving the pointer and epoch untouched. At turn start a persisted pointer whose target is structurally unestablishable (a deleted sandbox row, a Modal sibling, or an enrollment-less selfhosted row) is reset to the session home under the epoch fence and announced with a new `session.route.reconciled` event, honoring a concurrent higher-epoch swap rather than clobbering it. A null pointer resolves to the session home backend, and the routing proxy's per-op cache is keyed on the full `(activeEpoch, activeSandboxId)` tuple so a clear-to-null re-lands the next op on home rather than a stale swapped-to session. Adds the optional `SwapActiveSandboxResponse.code` discriminant and the `session.route.reconciled` session event type to the public contracts and SDK wire types.
- faf1487: Add workspace-local, holder-fenced Codex subscription leases with deterministic
  fairness across worker replicas, explicit allocator eligibility, and
  failure-classified same-turn failover. All-exhausted active goals now persist one
  generation- and policy-fenced capacity waiter, wake from authoritative reset
  timers or revisioned capacity mutations, survive Temporal restart and
  continue-as-new, and enqueue at most one normal continuation without synthetic
  user messages, full-turn replay, provider/model rewriting, or automatic
  entitlement redemption.

  Expose a generic accepted-turn policy-scope and per-scope unavailable-diagnostic
  seam for future named pools while resolving exact live/frozen same-turn reuse
  before membership filtering. Preserve manual versus policy pin semantics and
  session-sharded cache affinity without moving an in-flight lease or the legacy
  workspace pointer for policy homes.

- b804fd4: Add provider-neutral git credential contracts and runtime sandbox token-file seeding for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. Sandboxes now provision `gh`, `glab`, and `az` wrappers that read current token files at invocation time without storing token values in manifests.
- 5942493: Repair missing file-upload usage records on idempotent finalize retries, reclaim abandoned direct-upload objects through a fenced Temporal cleanup schedule, and preserve accessible provider-backed image previews across reloads.
- a5f58f9: Make "stop" mean stop, and stop the child-completion flood from outrunning it.

  - **Stop drains the queue.** A non-steer interrupt now cancels the active turn AND all queued turns, emitting one `turn.queue_drained` summary event. Steer still promotes exactly one steered message.
  - **A user-paused goal is sacred.** A machine child-completion turn can no longer re-activate a goal the user paused (`goal_set` is refused for such callers), and the wake text drops the "resume it now" nudge when the manager's own goal is user-paused. The caller is classified by its own signed turn identity (a new `turnId` claim on the first-party MCP token), not the session's live active pointer — so the guard cannot be raced into refusing a legitimate human `goal_set`.
  - **Child-completion notifications coalesce.** N spawned workers reaching terminal states now fold into ONE queued digest turn (one model run) instead of N turns, so the flood can no longer outrun a human's stop button. Each worker still gets its own result card.
  - **Human messages preempt machine notifications.** A person's message jumps ahead of any queued child-completion notification turns (behind the running turn and earlier human turns) — it never waits behind a flood of "worker FAILED" notices.
  - **Child-completion suppression opt-in.** A new first-party `set_child_notifications_mode` tool lets a manager switch spawned-worker completions to `passive`: they appear as timeline cards only and never queue a turn or a model run. `digest` remains the default.
  - **Honest steering copy.** The composer no longer claims steer "injects this message now"; it cancels the current step and runs the message next while the goal continues, and the stop button says it clears queued messages and pauses the goal.

- 9d4283d: Per-workspace model/provider hard-block policy. A new `workspace_model_policies` table (NULL = unrestricted) lets a workspace strictly allowlist which providers and/or exact model ids may serve its turns. Enforced twice: a 422 at every API model choke point (user message, queued-turn update, scheduled task, and session creation — where the EFFECTIVE model, `payload.model ?? deployment default`, is vetted, since an omitted model stamps the deployment default onto the session), and authoritatively in the worker immediately after turn model resolution, where a blocked provider/model throws `WorkspaceModelPolicyBlockedError` before any model call — including the legacy null-resolution fallback to the built-in OpenAI/Azure client, which is attributed to the built-in's own provider id so blocking the built-in also closes that path. Goal continuations that inherit a blocked model recover to the session's allowed default or pause the goal visibly with a truthful rationale. New `GET/PUT /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/model-policy` routes (read / admin) manage the policy. Workspaces without a policy row behave exactly as before. This exists so a codex-subscription workspace can be fail-closed to codex: a turn may wait or fail loud, but can never fall through to a paid provider.

## 0.4.6

### Patch Changes

- ac924ca: Fix Modal private-registry sandbox image handling for embedded deployments and republish the observability API surface.

  Modal registry Secrets are resolved through the authenticated OpenGeni Modal client, and Modal private-registry images are now warmed at turn time for pack-scoped sandbox images, not only at worker boot for the deployment-global image ref.

  `@opengeni/observability` is minor-bumped so the already-source-shipped `setGauge`, `incrementCounter`, `observeHistogram`, and `debug` methods are available to external consumers. The published direct dependents are patch-bumped so their 0.x caret ranges resolve to the new observability minor in a coherent install.

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- b34b912: Toolspace: selfhosted parity + generic programmatic-calling agent instructions.

  Connected-machine (selfhosted) turns now receive the toolspace token like every other backend. The git-token skip does not transfer: the platform GitHub token is inert on a user machine, but the toolspace token is the machine's only path to programmatic tool calling. It is safe to deliver because it grants no more than the machine owner's own authority — `toolspace:call` only, bound to its own session, turn TTL, budgeted, approval-tools excluded. Delivery mirrors the docker path: the token is seeded to `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_TOKEN_FILE` over the machine's exec channel, off-manifest, targeting the public sandbox-routable API URL; the platform setup hooks (repository clone, az login) still never run against the user's machine.

  When a toolspace token is minted for a turn (feature enabled, any backend), the agent's composed instructions carry a short, generic substrate note: every MCP tool is also callable programmatically from the sandbox via `ogtool` (or MCP JSON-RPC to `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL` with the bearer from `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_TOKEN_FILE`), prefer programmatic calls for loops/polling/bulk filtering because those results do not consume model context, and approval-required tools must still be invoked normally. The note composes after the workspace persona + CORE but before the per-session instructions. The `@opengeni/core` and `@opengeni/api-router` bumps are the dependent-closure patch for the runtime minor.

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- 602db89: Add Toolspace programmatic tool access for sandboxes.

  The new `toolspace:call` permission is an explicit, session-bound delegated grant for sandbox code. When `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_ENABLED=true`, worker turns mint a narrow `ogd_` token to a sandbox token file and expose `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL`; the first-party MCP route uses that token to compose the session's safe first-party, capability-backed, and per-session MCP tools, with approval-required tools denied as MCP `isError` results.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- e513236: Add an optional per-session `instructions` field to `CreateSessionRequest`: a first-class, system-level agent persona lever composed AFTER the per-workspace `agentInstructions` (session-specific last, non-bypassable CORE preserved). It is org-visible session metadata (returned on the session record) but is never emitted as a timeline event, so hosts can deliver per-agent-type prompts without leaking prompt content into the user-visible timeline or weakening instruction authority. Absent ⇒ byte-identical to today's composition.

### Minor Changes

- 2170732: Publish the full Stage C `@opengeni/*` runtime closure to npm so external hosts can consume OpenGeni from published packages instead of vendored workspace tarballs.

  The release pipeline now builds every publishable package, rewrites every published `workspace:*` dependency to a concrete semver range, rewrites source entry points to dist entry points for every publishable package, and leaves only leaf-only non-runtime packages ignored.
