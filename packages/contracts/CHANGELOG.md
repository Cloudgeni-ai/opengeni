## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 0805620: Make active-sandbox pointer swaps establishment-safe. A swap or create-time seed to a target no turn can establish (a non-group Modal sibling, or an unknown backend kind) is now rejected before the epoch-fenced pointer commit with a typed rejection `code`, leaving the pointer and epoch untouched. At turn start a persisted pointer whose target is structurally unestablishable (a deleted sandbox row, a Modal sibling, or an enrollment-less selfhosted row) is reset to the session home under the epoch fence and announced with a new `session.route.reconciled` event, honoring a concurrent higher-epoch swap rather than clobbering it. A null pointer resolves to the session home backend, and the routing proxy's per-op cache is keyed on the full `(activeEpoch, activeSandboxId)` tuple so a clear-to-null re-lands the next op on home rather than a stale swapped-to session. Adds the optional `SwapActiveSandboxResponse.code` discriminant and the `session.route.reconciled` session event type to the public contracts and SDK wire types.
- b804fd4: Add provider-neutral git credential contracts and runtime sandbox token-file seeding for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. Sandboxes now provision `gh`, `glab`, and `az` wrappers that read current token files at invocation time without storing token values in manifests.
- e4d3569: Add per-member workspace session pins with stable pinned-first listing, subject-scoped FORCE-RLS persistence, snapshot-backed activity pagination, optimistic OCC-safe pin/unpin updates, and accessible responsive web controls.

### Patch Changes

- 04d7595: Discover repositories at any workspace nesting depth, including linked worktrees whose `.git` marker is a file, while pruning dependency/build residue and enforcing timeout and repository-count bounds. An incomplete discovery now persists an epoch-fenced degraded capture revision, announces its typed reason, and makes clients prefer live workspace data instead of presenting a misleading empty capture.
- faf1487: Add workspace-local, holder-fenced Codex subscription leases with deterministic
  fairness across worker replicas, explicit allocator eligibility, and
  failure-classified same-turn failover. All-exhausted active goals now persist one
  generation- and policy-fenced capacity waiter, wake from authoritative reset
  timers or revisioned capacity mutations, survive Temporal restart and
  continue-as-new, and enqueue at most one normal continuation without synthetic
  user messages, full-turn replay, provider/model rewriting, or automatic
  entitlement redemption.

  Expose a generic accepted-turn policy-scope and per-scope unavailable-diagnostic
  seam for future named pools while resolving exact live/frozen same-turn reuse
  before membership filtering. Preserve manual versus policy pin semantics and
  session-sharded cache affinity without moving an in-flight lease or the legacy
  workspace pointer for policy homes.

- b125213: Proactively renew GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps credentials during multi-day managed-sandbox turns, atomically replacing stable token files without model action or manifest mutation.
- 4a25bfc: Add the `machine.link.lost`, `machine.link.restored`, and `machine.runner.restarted` session-event types for Connected Machine control-link observability (the failure-visibility doctrine's link plane). These are session-scoped, announce-only diagnostics fanned out only to the sessions that had an active op running on the machine when its control link changed — never to idle or historical sessions. A clean going-offline emits `machine.link.lost` (plus `machine.runner.restarted` when the reason is a self-update restart), and a reconnect Hello that actually cleared a going-offline marker emits `machine.link.restored`. All three project to the timeline's quiet tier (no rendered item) and are mirrored in the SDK event-type list. Adds the `sessionsWithActiveOpOnEnrollment` DB helper (one indexed lookup, no per-op tracking table) that resolves the fan-out target set.
- 3148404: Add the `machine.op.failed` and `machine.op.recovered` session-event types for Connected Machine op-outcome observability (the failure-visibility doctrine's out-of-band plane). These are session-scoped, announce-only diagnostics: `machine.op.failed` fires for infrastructure fault classes only (offline, draining-exhausted, payload-too-large, reconnecting-timeout, OS/stream/protocol) — never for a semantic miss the model asked about (a missing path, a consent gate, a nonzero exit); `machine.op.recovered` is the quiet healed-fault leading indicator. Both project to the timeline's quiet tier (no rendered item), mirrored in the SDK event-type list.
- 5942493: Repair missing file-upload usage records on idempotent finalize retries, reclaim abandoned direct-upload objects through a fenced Temporal cleanup schedule, and preserve accessible provider-backed image previews across reloads.
- a5f58f9: Make "stop" mean stop, and stop the child-completion flood from outrunning it.

  - **Stop drains the queue.** A non-steer interrupt now cancels the active turn AND all queued turns, emitting one `turn.queue_drained` summary event. Steer still promotes exactly one steered message.
  - **A user-paused goal is sacred.** A machine child-completion turn can no longer re-activate a goal the user paused (`goal_set` is refused for such callers), and the wake text drops the "resume it now" nudge when the manager's own goal is user-paused. The caller is classified by its own signed turn identity (a new `turnId` claim on the first-party MCP token), not the session's live active pointer — so the guard cannot be raced into refusing a legitimate human `goal_set`.
  - **Child-completion notifications coalesce.** N spawned workers reaching terminal states now fold into ONE queued digest turn (one model run) instead of N turns, so the flood can no longer outrun a human's stop button. Each worker still gets its own result card.
  - **Human messages preempt machine notifications.** A person's message jumps ahead of any queued child-completion notification turns (behind the running turn and earlier human turns) — it never waits behind a flood of "worker FAILED" notices.
  - **Child-completion suppression opt-in.** A new first-party `set_child_notifications_mode` tool lets a manager switch spawned-worker completions to `passive`: they appear as timeline cards only and never queue a turn or a model run. `digest` remains the default.
  - **Honest steering copy.** The composer no longer claims steer "injects this message now"; it cancels the current step and runs the message next while the goal continues, and the stop button says it clears queued messages and pauses the goal.

- 9d4283d: Per-workspace model/provider hard-block policy. A new `workspace_model_policies` table (NULL = unrestricted) lets a workspace strictly allowlist which providers and/or exact model ids may serve its turns. Enforced twice: a 422 at every API model choke point (user message, queued-turn update, scheduled task, and session creation — where the EFFECTIVE model, `payload.model ?? deployment default`, is vetted, since an omitted model stamps the deployment default onto the session), and authoritatively in the worker immediately after turn model resolution, where a blocked provider/model throws `WorkspaceModelPolicyBlockedError` before any model call — including the legacy null-resolution fallback to the built-in OpenAI/Azure client, which is attributed to the built-in's own provider id so blocking the built-in also closes that path. Goal continuations that inherit a blocked model recover to the session's allowed default or pause the goal visibly with a truthful rationale. New `GET/PUT /v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/model-policy` routes (read / admin) manage the policy. Workspaces without a policy row behave exactly as before. This exists so a codex-subscription workspace can be fail-closed to codex: a turn may wait or fail loud, but can never fall through to a paid provider.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 602db89: Add Toolspace programmatic tool access for sandboxes.

  The new `toolspace:call` permission is an explicit, session-bound delegated grant for sandbox code. When `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_ENABLED=true`, worker turns mint a narrow `ogd_` token to a sandbox token file and expose `OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL`; the first-party MCP route uses that token to compose the session's safe first-party, capability-backed, and per-session MCP tools, with approval-required tools denied as MCP `isError` results.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 7bfe593: Surface the desktop-capture-blocked reason as server-visible enrollment state.

  A machine can have a display it cannot CAPTURE (macOS Screen Recording / TCC not granted). The agent's connect Hello already withholds the desktop cell in that case; this persists a human, actionable reason alongside it so the Machines dashboard / VM picker can render "display: capture not granted" instead of a bare `display_unavailable`.

  - **Contracts / SDK**: `MachineView` (and `EnrollmentSummary`) gain an additive, nullable `desktopUnavailableReason`. Non-null only when a display exists but capture is blocked; `null` == capture permitted OR genuinely headless. Absent/`null` ⇒ byte-identical to today's shape for existing consumers.
  - **DB**: new nullable `enrollments.desktop_unavailable_reason` column (no backfill — `NULL` preserves the existing "capture-permitted or headless" semantics). The display-cursor writer now persists `has_display` AND the reason together, change-guarded on either field, and self-heals to `null` on the next Hello once the grant is restored.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 5ca067f: ClientConfig gains optional `serverVersion` (the release-train version baked into official server images, surfaced on /healthz and /v1/config/client); the unused `PageInfo`/`paginated()` exports are removed — list endpoints deliberately return bare arrays, and the events route's cursor scheme is the documented exception.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- e513236: Add an optional per-session `instructions` field to `CreateSessionRequest`: a first-class, system-level agent persona lever composed AFTER the per-workspace `agentInstructions` (session-specific last, non-bypassable CORE preserved). It is org-visible session metadata (returned on the session record) but is never emitted as a timeline event, so hosts can deliver per-agent-type prompts without leaking prompt content into the user-visible timeline or weakening instruction authority. Absent ⇒ byte-identical to today's composition.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 15deca0: Add per-session third-party MCP servers with write-only encrypted headers, metadata-only responses/events, `mcp_servers:attach` permission gating, and per-message credential rotation.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 548e307: Republish contracts so the registry version carries the current export surface (`MintEnrollTokenRequest` and the machines/enroll types) that `@opengeni/api-router@0.2.x` imports — the previously published 0.3.0 predates them.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 48c0d2e: Add session titles. A session now has a short display title that the agent generates itself: on the genesis turn a hidden, non-persisted directive asks the agent to call the new `set_session_title` tool, so the session is named on its own model with no extra LLM call. Users (and agents with `sessions:control`, via `set_other_session_title`) can rename; a user-set title is permanent and is never clobbered by agent writes.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: `Session.title` / `Session.titleSource`, `UpdateSessionRequest`, and the `session.title_set` event.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: `client.updateSession(workspaceId, sessionId, { title })`.
  - `@opengeni/react`: `useSession().updateTitle(...)`, live `session.title_set` handling, and `sessionDisplayTitle` now prefers `session.title`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 21c1535: Initial public release of the OpenGeni client packages.

  - `@opengeni/contracts`: shared zod wire-contract schemas and types.
  - `@opengeni/sdk`: zero-dependency, framework-agnostic TypeScript client with typed API, session lifecycle, and SSE streaming (reconnect + replay-by-sequence).
  - `@opengeni/react`: React hooks and styled components built on `@opengeni/sdk`.

  All three now ship ESM + `.d.ts` builds via tsup and are published to npm with provenance.
