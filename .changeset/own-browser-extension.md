A product can let its own branded build of the Opengeni Browser Chrome extension reach the person's agent. Set `browserExtensionIds` (Chrome's 32-letter extension IDs) in the desktop kit's config, or in `ThisComputer`'s options; the agent then lists those extensions next to Opengeni Browser in the Chrome Native Messaging host it registers. Standalone installs read the same list from `OPENGENI_AGENT_BROWSER_EXTENSION_IDS` when running `opengeni-agent service install`. This needs an agent built from this release or later.
