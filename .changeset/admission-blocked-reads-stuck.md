A session whose next turn the runtime refused to start (an admission block, such as a rejected database claim) no longer reads as "Waiting on you" with nothing to answer. It now reads as "Stuck" in the session header, lists, hover details, sub-agent rows and the timeline divider, on the web and in the native app. The web session notice is titled "Stuck" and, for a rejected claim, says nothing is needed from the person. The native session screen shows a matching card with a Try again action (Resume), and its composer offers Send instead of Stop while the session is stuck. Session list entries now carry `admissionBlock`, and the SDK's `Session` type gains the optional `admissionBlock`. New helpers `sessionDisplayStatus` and `sessionAdmissionBlocked` return the display status `blocked`, and the native timeline messages gain `stuckTitle`, `stuckBody`, `stuckAccessBody`, `stuckRetry` and `stuckRetryFailed` for hosts that swap copy.
