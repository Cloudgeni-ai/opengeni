"@opengeni/browserd": patch
---

A browser scroll aimed at an element now scrolls the nearest box around it that can actually move in that direction, as a mouse wheel over the element would, instead of calling scroll on the element itself, which did nothing for tables, rows and plain wrappers inside a scrolling panel. When nothing can move (already at the edge, or no scrollable box), both located and page scrolls now fail with a definite error instead of reporting success.
