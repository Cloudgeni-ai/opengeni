A connected MCP server's own icon now shows as its connector logo. When a workspace connects or enables its own (custom) MCP server, Opengeni reads the `icons` the server lists in its `initialize` reply (`serverInfo.icons`, MCP 2025-11-25), picks the best one for a single tile (theme-neutral before light or dark, vector before a large raster, favicons last), and stores it as the item's logo. Icons go through the same checks as vendored catalog logos (an image type the asset route serves, at most 512 KB, no scripts or external references in SVGs), are fetched through the deployment's outbound network policy with a timeout and at most three redirects, and are served from `/v1/catalog-assets/...`, so the browser never loads them from the server's host. A server without a usable icon keeps its monogram and connects as before. Tool steps from such a server also find the logo by the server's host. Editing a custom catalog item no longer clears its logo. New `@opengeni/capabilities` exports: `mcpServerIcons`, `rankMcpServerIcons`, `decodeDataUriIcon`, `validateLogoAsset`, `catalogAssetObjectKey` and the other logo-asset checks previously private to the catalog scripts; new `@opengeni/db` export `setWorkspaceCapabilityCatalogItemLogo`.
