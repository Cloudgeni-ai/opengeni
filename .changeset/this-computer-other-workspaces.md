Using this computer in a second workspace no longer fails. A person's own computer already serves every workspace they belong to on the same server, so connecting it in another workspace now reuses the existing connection and only lets the person's agents there use it, instead of setting it up again (which the server refuses). Turning it off in one workspace takes back only that workspace's standing permission (new `disallowAgentsOnComputer`) and keeps it on elsewhere; it is disconnected when the last workspace stops using it.
