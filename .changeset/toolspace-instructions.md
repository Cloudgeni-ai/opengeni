Toolspace: selfhosted parity + generic programmatic-calling agent instructions.

Connected-machine (selfhosted) turns now receive the toolspace token like every other backend. The git-token skip does not transfer: the platform GitHub token is inert on a user machine, but the toolspace token is the machine's only path to programmatic tool calling. It is safe to deliver because it grants no more than the machine owner's own authority — `toolspace:call` only, bound to its own session, turn TTL, budgeted, approval-tools excluded. Delivery mirrors the docker path: the token is seeded to `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_TOKEN_FILE` over the machine's exec channel, off-manifest, targeting the public sandbox-routable API URL; the platform setup hooks (repository clone, az login) still never run against the user's machine.

When a toolspace token is minted for a turn (feature enabled, any backend), the agent's composed instructions carry a short, generic substrate note: every MCP tool is also callable programmatically from the sandbox via `ogtool` (or MCP JSON-RPC to `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_URL` with the bearer from `$OPENGENI_TOOLSPACE_TOKEN_FILE`), prefer programmatic calls for loops/polling/bulk filtering because those results do not consume model context, and approval-required tools must still be invoked normally. The note composes after the workspace persona + CORE but before the per-session instructions. The `@opengeni/core` and `@opengeni/api-router` bumps are the dependent-closure patch for the runtime minor.
