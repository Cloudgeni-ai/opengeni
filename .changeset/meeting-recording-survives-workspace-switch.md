A meeting recording no longer stops when the person switches to another workspace. The recorder stays with the workspace the recording started in until it stops, then moves to the workspace shown. On the web and in the desktop app the recorder is also kept through a dropped connection or an update. After Stop, a recording made in another workspace opens in its own workspace. `MeetingRecorderProvider`'s `onOpenMeeting` now also receives the meeting's workspace ID. `useMeetingRecorder()` returns the recorder's `workspaceId` and `openMeeting`, and `createMeetingRecorderStore` takes an optional second argument that opens a meeting in its workspace. A new account still ends a recording at once.
