Embedding products can show their own name everywhere people look.

- `@opengeni/react`: a `productName` prop on `OpenGeniProvider` and `OpenGeniMessagesProvider` (and `createOpenGeniText`) fills `{product}` in every built-in string that names the product, such as credit labels and recovery notices. Default "Opengeni".
- `@opengeni/agent-host`: `browserExtension: false` keeps an app's own agent from registering as the Opengeni Browser extension's native host, and removes a registration it made earlier, so another agent on the same computer keeps the extension.
- The agent's browser and computer helpers now run as `browserd` and `computer-native`, so Activity Monitor and Task Manager show no product name under an app that runs the agent under its own name. Older names beside an installed agent are still found.
