App-shots in the desktop app. When turned on in Settings → Machines, a shortcut (both Command keys on macOS by default) attaches the window you are looking at in another app to the chat you are using: a screenshot plus the window's app, title and the text it shows, including text scrolled out of view. Nothing is sent until you send it, and the attachment can be removed first. The agent receives the window's text as untrusted data inside that message only, so earlier turns stay unchanged. When your computer is connected to the workspace, the agent also learns which machine and window it was, so it can keep working in that window with computer tools; for a browser window it also gets the page address and the browser profile connected through the Opengeni extension, so it can continue in that tab with browser tools. Uploads accept an optional `appShot` description for image files (`uploadFile` in the SDK), and `useFileAttachments` gains `addAppShot`. macOS only for now; Windows and Linux plug into the same capture boundary.
