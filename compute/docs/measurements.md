# Measurements

Observations from lab runs, not bounds. Firecracker v1.17.0 under its jailer,
one host agent per host, synthetic data only. Measured on 2026-10-16 at
revision `282fea09e` of this directory; later changes before the lab
branch's head touch only how template builds book disk, and tests.

Each sandbox has 1 vCPU and 512 MiB. "First response" is the time from the
wake request until a command in the guest answers; "done" is until that
command finishes. "a/b" means p50/p90 across the sandboxes woken together.
Each run puts the sandboxes to sleep and wakes them twice; the numbers are
from the second round, after the working set was learned once.

Workload (the "realistic" set): each sandbox copies a repository, runs its
tests and commits; each wake reads the repository and loads it in Node.

## Hosts

| Host | Machine | Memory profile | Object storage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bare metal | GCP z3-highmem-192-highlssd-metal (192 vCPUs), us-central1-a, local NVMe | `bare-metal`: 4 KiB pages, compression | GCS, same region |
| Nested | GCP n2-highmem-32, a VM with nested virtualization, europe-north1-a, local NVMe | `nested`: 2 MiB huge pages | GCS, same region |

The Compressed rows on the nested host use the bare-metal profile, because
huge pages cannot be compressed.

## Waking

| Level | Bare metal, 1 | Bare metal, 100 at once | Nested, 1 | Nested, 100 at once |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Paused | 12 ms (done 97 ms) | 78/121 ms (done 197/238 ms) | 12 ms (done 134 ms) | 145/218 ms (done 769/889 ms) |
| Compressed | 57 ms (done 298 ms) | 168/207 ms (done 629/694 ms) | 154 ms (done 686 ms) | 4.4/4.8 s (done 14.9/15.3 s) |
| Saved | 104 ms (done 303 ms) | 277/385 ms (done 443/536 ms) | 166 ms (done 308 ms) | 1.2/2.0 s (done 1.9/2.5 s) |
| Archived | 127 ms (done 327 ms) | 292/416 ms (done 532/617 ms) | 169 ms (done 309 ms) | 1.2/1.9 s (done 1.8/2.4 s) |
| Remote | 1.4 s (done 1.6 s) | 6.8/9.2 s (done 8.3/9.9 s) | 0.77 s (done 0.91 s) | 17.7/20.7 s (done 18.3/21.0 s) |

- Saved and Archived wake from the local disk, usually from the host's file
  cache.
- Remote first fetches the sandbox's working-set pack (128 MiB here), then
  the pager serves the rest as the guest touches it. One fetch took 1.06 s on
  bare metal and 0.54 s on the nested host. With 100 at once the fetches
  share the host's network and fetch slots: a fetch took 2.6 s on average on
  bare metal and 5.7 s on the nested host, and wakes queued for them. A few
  uploads met GCS 429 and 503 answers and were retried; every sandbox
  completed.
- Compressed with 100 at once is slow on the nested host because 4 KiB page
  faults are expensive under nesting; such hosts run the nested profile.

Time until 100 sandboxes all reached a level, once their rule allowed it:

| Level | Bare metal | Nested |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Paused | 0.16 s | 0.12 s |
| Compressed | 11.0 s | 16.5 s |
| Saved | 3.8 s | 30.7 s |
| Archived | 86 s | 67 s |
| Remote | 126 s | 116 s |

## Host memory per sandbox

| Level | Bare metal | Nested |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Paused | 269 MiB less available host memory. Its cgroup is charged 690 MiB, because that includes its disk's file cache, which the kernel can reclaim | 303 MiB of huge pages |
| Compressed | 64 MiB resident and 57 MiB compressed; 111 MiB less available | not used (59 MiB and 55 MiB with the bare-metal profile) |
| Saved, Archived, Remote | none | none |

## Agent restart

`kill -9` of the agent with 100 sandboxes, 25 each Running, Paused, Saved in
place (paused in RAM with a saved copy) and Saved:

| | Bare metal | Nested |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Serving again after | 347 ms | 325 ms |
| Sandboxes lost | none | none |
| Wake after restart: Running | 0.5/0.8 ms | 0.6/1.1 ms |
| Paused | 73/87 ms | 45/99 ms |
| Saved in place | 96/127 ms | 76/90 ms |
| Saved | 191/200 ms | 174/214 ms |

With 100 Remote sandboxes, a restart was serving after 478 ms on the nested
host and 643 ms on bare metal, and had settled every record after 510 and
742 ms. One remote wake right after the restart answered in 1.0 s on the
nested host and 4.0 s on bare metal (a single sample each).

## New sandboxes

Create until a first command (reading the id, 16 random bytes and dmesg)
finishes in the new sandbox; 1, then 100 at once.

| Start | Bare metal: 1 / 100 at once | Nested: 1 / 100 at once |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ready pool (a resume) | 56 ms / 151/214 ms, all in 0.29 s | 54 ms / 582/827 ms, all in 1.0 s |
| Template (a restore) | 197 ms / 1.7/2.1 s, all in 2.2 s | 189 ms / 1.6/2.1 s, all in 2.2 s |
| Cold boot | 1.6 s / 3.5/3.7 s, all in 4.0 s | 1.6 s / 8.4/9.6 s, all in 9.9 s |

Filling a ready pool of 101 took 9.3 s on bare metal and 9.5 s on the nested
host. A template was ready 4.0 to 4.6 s after it was asked for.

## Memory pressure

On bare metal, with other processes taking the host's memory away until it
was short, a busy sandbox above its request gave its cache back through its
balloon in 1.1 s; an idle one was paused and saved in 0.7 s, and a sandbox
waiting for room woke 105 ms after the room came back.

## Network

100 sandboxes restored from Saved all answered within 3.8 s (bare metal) and
4.6 s (nested). Each then tried every blocked destination: the host, the
cloud metadata address, internal ranges and every other sandbox. All 10,700
attempts per host were refused, unreachable or dropped. A first outbound
connection took 17/18 ms on bare metal and 25/56 ms on the nested host.

## Agent memory

Proportional set size of the agent:

| State | Bare metal | Nested |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No sandboxes | 38 MB | 15 MB |
| 100 sandboxes running | 154 MB | 59 MB |
| 100 Remote sandboxes, settled | 141 MB | 112 MB |
| After a restart with 100 Remote sandboxes | 104 MB | 51 MB |
| After removing all 100 | 97 MB | 47 MB |

The bare-metal host has 192 processors, and the agent keeps a worker and
some buffers per processor. With 100 Remote sandboxes most of the rest is
pooled connections to object storage, which close within minutes.

Two changes got it here. With glibc's allocator the agent held about 750 MB
after archiving 100 sandboxes on bare metal, although only about 35 MB was
live: freed memory stayed in per-thread arenas made by hundreds of blocking
threads. jemalloc, also used for the C code the agent links, brought that to
126 MB. And chunks fetched for remote wakes stayed in a cache for the agent's
lifetime (about 250 MB); they now expire 60 s after arrival, which took the
agent's memory after removal from 286 MB to 55 MB.

## Cost per sleeping sandbox

Priced at GCP us-central1 on-demand list prices: memory $0.004237 per
GiB-hour (N2, about $3.09 per GiB-month), local SSD about $0.08 per GB-month,
GCS standard storage about $0.020 per GB-month. A sleeping sandbox uses no
processor time.

| Level | What it holds | About per month |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Paused | 0.26 to 0.30 GiB of RAM | $0.81 to $0.92 |
| Compressed | 0.11 GiB of RAM | $0.34 |
| Saved | its memory image (0.33 GB here) and what it wrote to its disk, on local SSD; the base disk is shared | $0.03 plus its writes |
| Remote | its compressed memory image (90 MB here) and its disk's changes; chunks of the base disk are shared | under $0.01 |

A running sandbox costs what its memory and processors use.
